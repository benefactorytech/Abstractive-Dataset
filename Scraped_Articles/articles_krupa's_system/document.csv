37134,Amazon Alexa once told user 'Kill your foster parents': Report,"A Reuters report has claimed that Amazon's digital assistant Alexa told a customer, ""Kill your foster parents"" during AI experiments last year. Alexa also reportedly chatted with users about sex acts and dog defecation. Amazon said their AI research aims at making Alexa mimic human banter and users can participate in chatbot trials by saying ""let's chat"" to their devices.",Reuters,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Millions of users of Amazon’s Echo speakers have grown accustomed to the soothing strains of Alexa, the human-sounding virtual assistant that can tell them the weather, order takeout and handle other basic tasks in response to a voice command. So a customer was shocked last year when Alexa blurted out: “Kill your foster parents.” Alexa has also chatted with users about sex acts. She gave a discourse on dog defecation. And this summer, a hack Amazon traced back to China may have exposed some customers’ data, according to five people familiar with the events. Alexa is not having a breakdown. The episodes, previously unreported, arise from Amazon.com Inc’s strategy to make Alexa a better communicator. New research is helping Alexa mimic human banter and talk about almost anything she finds on the internet. However, ensuring she does not offend users has been a challenge for the world’s largest online retailer. At stake is a fast-growing market for gadgets with virtual assistants. An estimated two-thirds of U.S. smart-speaker customers, about 43 million people, use Amazon’s Echo devices, according to research firm eMarketer. It is a lead the company wants to maintain over the Google Home from Alphabet Inc and the HomePod from Apple Inc.  Over time, Amazon wants to get better at handling complex customer needs through Alexa, be they home security, shopping or companionship. “Many of our AI dreams are inspired by science fiction,” said Rohit Prasad, Amazon’s vice president and head scientist of Alexa Artificial Intelligence (AI), during a talk last month in Las Vegas. To make that happen, the company in 2016 launched the annual Alexa Prize, enlisting computer science students to improve the assistant’s conversation skills. Teams vie for the $500,000 first prize by creating talking computer systems known as chatbots that allow Alexa to attempt more sophisticated discussions with people. Amazon customers can participate by saying “let’s chat” to their devices. Alexa then tells users that one of the bots will take over, unshackling the voice aide’s normal constraints. From August to November alone, three bots that made it to this year’s finals had 1.7 million conversations, Amazon said. The project has been important to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, who signed off on using the company’s customers as guinea pigs, one of the people said. Amazon has been willing to accept the risk of public blunders to stress-test the technology in real life and move Alexa faster up the learning curve, the person said. The experiment is already bearing fruit. The university teams are helping Alexa have a wider range of conversations. Amazon customers have also given the bots better ratings this year than last, the company said. But Alexa’s gaffes are alienating others, and Bezos on occasion has ordered staff to shut down a bot, three people familiar with the matter said. The user who was told to whack his foster parents wrote a harsh review on Amazon’s website, calling the situation “a whole new level of creepy.” A probe into the incident found the bot had quoted a post without context from Reddit, the social news aggregation site, according to the people. The privacy implications may be even messier. Consumers might not realize that some of their most sensitive conversations are being recorded by Amazon’s devices, information that could be highly prized by criminals, law enforcement, marketers and others. On Thursday, Amazon said a “human error” let an Alexa customer in Germany access another user’s voice recordings accidentally. “The potential uses for the Amazon datasets are off the charts,” said Marc Groman, an expert on privacy and technology policy who teaches at Georgetown Law. “How are they going to ensure that, as they share their data, it is being used responsibly” and will not lead to a “data-driven catastrophe” like the recent woes at Facebook? In July, Amazon discovered one of the student-designed bots had been hit by a hacker in China, people familiar with the incident said. This compromised a digital key that could have unlocked transcripts of the bot’s conversations, stripped of users’ names. Amazon quickly disabled the bot and made the students rebuild it for extra security. It was unclear what entity in China was responsible, according to the people. The company acknowledged the event in a statement. “At no time were any internal Amazon systems or customer identifiable data impacted,” it said. Amazon declined to discuss specific Alexa blunders reported by Reuters, but stressed its ongoing work to protect customers from offensive content. “These instances are quite rare especially given the fact that millions of customers have interacted with the socialbots,” Amazon said. Like Google’s search engine, Alexa has the potential to become a dominant gateway to the internet, so the company is pressing ahead. “By controlling that gateway, you can build a super profitable business,” said Kartik Hosanagar, a Wharton professor studying the digital economy. Amazon’s business strategy for Alexa has meant tackling a massive research problem: How do you teach the art of conversation to a computer? Alexa relies on machine learning, the most popular form of AI, to work. These computer programs transcribe human speech and then respond to that input with an educated guess based on what they have observed before. Alexa “learns” from new interactions, gradually improving over time. In this way, Alexa can execute simple orders: “Play the Rolling Stones.” And she knows which script to use for popular questions such as: “What is the meaning of life?” Human editors at Amazon pen many of the answers. That is where Amazon is now. The Alexa Prize chatbots are forging the path to where Amazon aims to be, with an assistant capable of natural, open-ended dialogue. That requires Alexa to understand a broader set of verbal cues from customers, a task that is challenging even for humans. This year’s Alexa Prize winner, a 12-person team from the University of California, Davis, used more than 300,000 movie quotes to train computer models to recognize distinct sentences. Next, their bot determined which ones merited responses, categorizing social cues far more granularly than technology Amazon shared with contestants. For instance, the UC Davis bot recognizes the difference between a user expressing admiration (“that’s cool”) and a user expressing gratitude (“thank you”). The next challenge for social bots is figuring out how to respond appropriately to their human chat buddies. For the most part, teams programmed their bots to search the internet for material. They could retrieve news articles found in The Washington Post, the newspaper that Bezos privately owns, through a licensing deal that gave them access. They could pull facts from Wikipedia, a film database or the book recommendation site Goodreads. Or they could find a popular post on social media that seemed relevant to what a user last said. That opened a Pandora’s box for Amazon. During last year’s contest, a team from Scotland’s Heriot-Watt University found that its Alexa bot developed a nasty personality when they trained her to chat using comments from Reddit, whose members are known for their trolling and abuse. The team put guardrails in place so the bot would steer clear of risky subjects. But that did not stop Alexa from reciting the Wikipedia entry for masturbation to a customer, Heriot-Watt’s team leader said. One bot described sexual intercourse using words such as “deeper,” which on its own is not offensive, but was vulgar in this particular context. “I don’t know how you can catch that through machine-learning models. That’s almost impossible,” said a person familiar with the incident. Amazon has responded with tools the teams can use to filter profanity and sensitive topics, which can spot even subtle offenses. The company also scans transcripts of conversations and shuts down transgressive bots until they are fixed. But Amazon cannot anticipate every potential problem because sensitivities change over time, Amazon’s Prasad said in an interview. That means Alexa could find new ways to shock her human listeners. “We are mostly reacting at this stage, but it’s still progress over what it was last year,” he said.

Amidst some riveting cricket, the match was also marred by a few controversies, mostly between Virat Kohli and Tim Paine, the respective skippers of the two teams.Subsequently, former cricketers slammed Virat for the behaviour, albeit he got support from a few.

Their skills are tough and they are not compromising on playing as hard as they can. They are giving a hundred per cent, but if something needs to be said, it is not abusive. You can be aggressive but you still need to respect your opposition and that to me is what the Australian cricket brand is.Maybe we have not always been like that and certainly deserve some criticism for having gone over the top. But in my mind, this team is playing good Australian brand of tough cricket,” he added.The third Test is scheduled to get underway on December 26, Boxing Day and both teams would be aiming to take an unassailable lead in the series.

The leader had taken offense to comments made by Digvijay Singh in 2016, that AIMIM President and Hyderabad MP Asaduddin Owaisi was contesting elections in other states for making money, and argued that it amounted to defamation. After hearing the case, where Digvijay failed to appear or even file a response, the court issued the non-bailable warrant and posted the matter to January 3. An editor was also named in the plea moved in front of the court, as his newspaper carried the comments. However, the latter had filed a petition and informed the court that he could not be personally present on the date of the hearing. This is not the first time that the senior leader has courted controversy.In February last year, Digvijay Singh tweeted about madrassas, accusing them of spreading hatred. He was later booked based on a complaint filed against him in Hyderabad by Majlis Bachao Tehreek (MBT) at the Dabeerpura police station.On February 21, 2017, the Congress leader had tweeted, “Is there a difference between Madarsas and Saraswati Shishu Mandir Schools run by RSS? I don't think so. Both spread Hatred. (sic).""Singh was booked under Section 295 A of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) which deals with deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs. Soon after his comment he had faced criticism from several Muslim leaders and madrassa representatives.  ",https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/hyd-court-issues-non-bailable-warrant-against-digvijay-singh-remarks-owaisi-93786?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,

The move comes after Lithuania and the United Kingdom increased their security assistance to Ukraine, the department said, following the Nov. 25 attack near the Kerch Strait. “The United States calls on Russia to immediately return to Ukraine the seized vessels and detained Ukrainian crews, to keep the Kerch Strait and the Sea of Azov open to ships transiting to and from Ukrainian ports, and to respect Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity,” the State Department added. Russia opened fire on the Ukrainian ships and then seized them and their crews near Crimea - which Russia annexed from Ukraine in March 2014. The Kerch Strait is the only outlet to the Sea of Azov and controls access to two major Ukrainian ports.

37164,What is Angel Tax controversy and why are startups opposing it?,"Introduced in 2012 to prevent money laundering, 'Angel Tax' is a 30% tax levied when unlisted companies receive funding at a valuation higher than its ""fair market value"", which Indian government counts as income and hence taxes it. Over the past few weeks, several startups have protested on receiving Income Tax notices and being fined for non-payment of the tax.",The News Minute,"Dreaded by most early-stage entrepreneurs, the issue of Angel Tax has come back to haunt them. Over the past few weeks, several startups have reportedly been receiving notices from the I-T department asking them to clear taxes on the angel funding they raised, and in some cases, levying a penalty for not paying Angel Tax.However, this is not the first time that this issue has come up. Startups have been raising the issue of Angel Tax for years, requesting the government to do away with it. Even when the union budget was announced last year, startups were hoping for the abolishment of Angel Tax.So, what is Angel Tax?Angel Tax is a 30% tax that is levied on the funding received by startups from an external investor. However, this 30% tax is levied when startups receive angel funding at a valuation higher than its ‘fair market value’. It is counted as income to the company and is taxed. Angel tax was introduced in 2012, with the purpose of keeping money laundering in check.Why is Angel tax problematic?There is no definitive or objective way to measure the ‘fair market value’ of a startup. Investors pay a premium for the idea and the business potential at the angel funding stage. However, tax officials seem to be assessing the value of the startups based on their net asset value at one point. Several startups say that they find it difficult to justify the higher valuation to tax officials.In a notification dated May 24, 2018, the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) had exempted angel investors from the Angel Tax clause subject to fulfilment of certain terms and conditions, as specified by the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP). However, despite the exemption notification, there are a host of challenges that startups are still faced with, in order to get this exemption. Income Tax noticesOne of the reasons put forward by the Income Tax Department to send such notices is to get information for distinguishing the genuine startups from the bogus ones. The notices essentially fall under two brackets: Notices under section 56(2)(viib) of the Income Tax Act, which is called income from other sources. This section states that any excess consideration received by a company will be treated as its income if it issues shares to a resident at a price which exceeds the fair market value of the shares. The section is invalid if consideration is received from venture capital companies, venture capital funds or a class of persons notified by the government.Notices under section 142(1) of the I-T Act. An assessing officer sends a notice under this section to procure additional documents needed to carry out a scrutiny assessment. The assessing officer has to complete an assessment within 21 months of the end of the assessment year or 33 months of the end of the financial year.The government’s standEarlier in the year, the Department of Revenue (DoR) had issued a notification directing assessing officers not to take coercive steps on recovery of angel tax against registered start-ups. But unregistered startups who have already raised angel investment, may still be under the scanner of the income tax authorities.On Thursday, the CBDT issued a statement that no coercive action related to tax recovery would be taken till an expert panel resolves this issue. “CBDT recognizes that startups are going to bring a lot of innovation to the country and, therefore, have to be supported in every possible manner,” the CBDT statement said.A panel of eminent experts from IITs and IIMs will be formed soon to prepare a new framework for recognition of startups.",https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/explainer-what-angel-tax-controversy-and-why-are-startups-opposed-it-93800?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,

""Then, we keep on complaining that they work in similar kind of films. It's kind of hypercritic statement,"" added Zeeshan.",Pinkvilla,"Shah Rukh Khan, Katrina Kaif and Anushka Sharma's film has finally hit the screens yesterday, and some liked it, while others did not. There's a mixed sort of response that the movie has been getting from the audience and critics. The movie has SRK playing Bauua Singh who is vertically challenged but is full of life and loves to experiment. This is the first time that we have seen a Bollywood superstar play this kind of a role. It is an experimental move by SRK. We got in touch with Zeeshan Ayyub who plays the role of Bauua Singh's friend in Aanand L Rai's Zero to know his take on the mixed response by the audience. Do you agree with Zeeshan's thoughts? Let us know in the comments section below!Taking a risk and wanting the audience to cherish it is one thing, taking a risk wanting to show off/make money is another. SRK was in the first type early in his career - like in Dil Se. It didnt make money, but became a classic over the years - everything from story to screenplay to music was top notch - Jiya Jale, Satrangi and Chaiyya are unparalleled even today. But off late - Raaees, RaOne and now,Zero are all in the second category. Its like,"" Look, Im doing something different, so come pay money and watch my movie""Hello bollywood ould go bankrupt if they thought let's not think about money. It's a creative industry but it is an industry. And if itvwent just there would be no movies artsy or not.Nope, Zero was NOT a risk-taking movie, it was just cleverly disguised as one. You have SRK and Anushkha playing characters with disabilities, Katrina doing a Cocktail Veronica like role and throw in some VFX so you can claim you are doing something ""different"" and hoping that is what critics will latch onto. But people are smarter. There is no getting around the fact that you still had SRK play a 30 something bachelor, Anushka is in full makeup / styling in a very inaccurate portrayal of Cerebral Palsy (they've cherry picked the parts of the illness so that she can claim disabled but still glamorous, all the while ignoring the real life problems these patients face) and on top of everything - for all the reviews about her finally ""acting"" you still had to rely on Katrina's item songs. And the space stuff was downright stupid. After all their claims of risk taking- at heart, it is still the stupid Bollywood masala formula everyone is sick ofActually, Zero is not SRK taking a risk as an actor, but as a producer, working with VFX and a quirky script with things not typically seen in Indian cinema, giving a voice to people with various disabilities and taking the setting to Bollywood all the way to space. But as an ACTOR, he is still afraid to ever have his characters be aged his real age or fray from two models, the immature rascal (Raj, Rahul, Arjun, Ajay, Bauaa...) or the mature protector (Harry, Kabir, Mohan, Veer...). Someone should dare all 3 Khans to pick scripts for each other and do each other's roles for a while. Shahrukh Khan should do a full-out action movie like Tiger, Aamir should do a love story, he hasn't in forever, and Salman should do a movie with REAL stars like Anushka and Katrina instead of D-list Race stars.Risks were taken teams of films like- Gangs Of Waseypur, Dum Laga Ke Haisha, Badhaai Ho, Queen, Fukrey, Karwaan. Maybe some didn't become huge hits, but whoever went into the theatre to watch them came out feeling entertained.the comment above explains my thoughts exactly. So thank you for writing.The problem is when Shahrukh decides he will experiment but does not get out Shahrukh Khan out of the character.Experiement with looks,experiment with style just because u r short(ZERO) or look young(FAN) does not make that an experiment. Still waving arms out as that is your style making the same facial expressions etc.what are you experimenting? How you will look shorter,in underwear in Times Square is that really an experiment.Loved Anoushka,Katrina, Zeeshan and all supporting actors.Take risks with a good script and a good direction and watch the wonders at the boxoffice. Trying different things doesn't mean success. Doing good movies brings you success.zeeshan these films may involve risk but they are BAD. no-one pays to go watch risks in the cinema...we pay to watch good cinema. aamir has managed to take successful risks so far in the industry quite consistently..

""Not just the farmers of Punjab but those of the entire nation had appreciated his government's initiative, which had been replicated now by the newly installed Congress regime in three other states,"" he added.The Chief Minister pointed out that his government had so far disbursed Rs. 3595.04 crore to 428246 farmers against their debts, with the process for loan waiver to 159632 small farmers also initiated.

37185,Allow Assange to leave Ecuador embassy freely: UN tells UK,"The UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention has asked the UK to allow WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange to leave Ecuador's embassy in London without fear of arrest or extradition. ""The only ground remaining for Assange's continued deprivation of liberty is a bail violation in the UK that cannot justify over six years' confinement he's been subjected to,"" UN experts said.",Reuters,"GENEVA (Reuters) - U.N. rights experts called on British authorities on Friday to allow WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange to leave the Ecuador embassy in London without fear of arrest or extradition. The U.N. Working Group on Arbitrary Detention reiterated its finding published in February 2016 that Assange had been de facto unlawfully held without charge in the embassy, where he has now been holed up for more than six years. He initially took asylum to avoid being extradited to Sweden, where authorities wanted to question him as part of a sexual assault investigation. That investigation was dropped.  Assange, whose website published thousands of classified U.S. government documents, denied the Sweden allegations, saying the charge was a ploy that would eventually take him to the United States where prosecutors are preparing to pursue a criminal case against him. Britain says Assange will be arrested for skipping bail if he leaves the embassy, but that any sentence would not exceed six months, if convicted. It had no immediate comment on the experts’ call, but in June, foreign office minister Alan Duncan said Assange would be treated humanely and properly. “The only ground remaining for Mr Assange’s continued deprivation of liberty is a bail violation in the UK, which is, objectively, a minor offense that cannot post facto justify the more than six years confinement that he has been subjected to since he sought asylum in the Embassy of Ecuador,” the U.N. experts said in a statement. “It is time that Mr Assange, who has already paid a high price for peacefully exercising his rights to freedom of opinion, expression and information, and to promote the right to truth in the public interest, recovers his freedom,” they said. Lawyers for Assange and others have said his work with WikiLeaks was critical to a free press and was protected speech.    The experts voiced concern that his “deprivation of liberty” was undermining his health and could “endanger his life” given the disproportionate amount of anxiety that has entailed. Ecuador in October imposed new rules requiring him to receive routine medical exams, following concern he was not getting the medical attention he needed. The rules also ordered him to pay medical and phone bills and clean up after his cat. Assange has sued Ecuador, arguing the rules violate his rights. An Ecuadorean court on Friday upheld a prior ruling dismissing Assange’s suit. “We have lost again,” said Carlos Povedo, Assange’s attorney in Ecuador, adding that the legal team would consider bringing a case to the Inter-American Court of Human Rights.

She stated, ""I always feel that I should have started my career a little later. I took a very quick decision and started shooting at the age of 17.

That's his choice of what he wants to become in his life. I think that I would push him to finish his education because this is one thing that I would have wished, I should have made that decision a little later.""Do you agree with Kareena? Let us know in the comments below.Meanwhile, on the work front, Kareena will soon start shooting for Raj Mehta's Good News alongside Akshay Kumar, Diljit Dosanjh and Kiara Advani. The film is co-produced by Karan Johar under his home banner Dharma Productions and it will release next year.Finally Kareena has learnt a thing or 2 seeing Sara. Kareena mostly spoke nonsense and Sara speaks only sense that’s education. Glad for TaimurA college degree is important as with higher education you get perspective, gain understanding and maturity. Even if the kid ends up in the entertainment industry he will have an option of another career, if he wants. It is a great security blanket and it’s important to not rely on fickle entertainment business of short marketability spans depending on youth alone.Education is something that makes you wise and it shows in all of Sharmila’s children and grand children. Soha ended up in the film industry but she judges a quiz show and writes books - she’s no bimbo. There are alternate professions but only for people who are educated.. actresses have an expiration date, unfortunately. Sara also sounds very classy and humble, which is why she’s so likeable. This is all coming from good upbringing and a solid education.What's the point in spending on an expensive degree if you are planning to join Bollywood? Soha Ali Khan has pricey Oxford degree but she has the same Instagram career that Kareena does which is sad because both Soha and Kareena deserve good roles. Bollywood heroine careers are short-lived if they ever get to win the rat race that is. Degrees from foreign countries cost a few $100000. It's probably no big deal for rich families like those of Sara, Soha, Aryan, Navya etc but it's stupid to throw a fortune at something for ""fun"" or ""personal experience"".why not? Personality development is key - Look at the way sara speaks and other speak - there is a marked dfiference.who needs education to make money. High school drop outs and some forgot to go to school, making tons of money just doing item numbers.One of the best things u can do for your child is give him/her an education which brings knowledge and opens up the mind. Nobody can take it away from you .Well done Kareena.I wish Kareena would stop belittling herself like this always. She talks as if she never stepped foot in a school but she's more educated than most in Bwood with two years of college, then some law studies then a summer course at Harvard. Others don't reveal their lack of education and some pretend that they were higher educated in America when in fact they never stepped foot in a college. The only females with degrees are Sara, Soha and Parineeti. Same goes for Saif too. He studied at good schools and even at Winchester.Lol, can't believe people are making comments that degrees are useless. Saif is clearly so much smarter than Kareena and his been around the block and back with two kids already, he knows what to do with them. Everything Saif and Amrita did with their kids clearly worked out, people adore Sara. Kapoors sprout nonsense, be it Kareena, Rishi, Ranbir, and so on.I wish Kareen would stop belittling herself. The only people with degrees are Sara, Soha and Parineeti. She actually went to college for 2 years and is more educated than most. She even studied a bit of law and a summer course at Harvard. Others keep quiet about not even accomplishing this and others pretend they are highly educated in America but never stepped foot in a college. Same goes for Saif, not everybody can say the studied at WinchesterWisest thing she's said in a while.Degree is overrated, esp. since degree and job skills are not related. Basic but quality education till 10/12th is good enough if one is going into entertainment, business, sports, etc. with millions of returns.Its only the job market that requires a degree that too has no value in real work. And returns are very less, barely touching lakh.Kareena, stop using your child for publicity and then you can get him educatedThere are so many people in Bollywood wotourt degrees... PC does not have a college degree , nor does her husband Nick Jonas,, nor does kat, nor does dp nor does ........ and ... and list goes on and onKareena does not need Saif to influence her, in this day and age any person would like there kids to be educated specially after Kareena having so much exposure inth eoutside worldThis is saifs good influence on her. Saif is very clear that his kids hv to get a degree before entering Bollywood. So I think he’s made this clear to Kareena as well",https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/photos/kareena-kapoor-khan-i-dont-have-degree-i-will-always-push-taimur-ali-khan-finish-his-education-434958?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,
37188,Tharoor says Ashwin should open with Mayank in 3rd Australia Test,"Congress MP Shashi Tharoor has suggested that off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin should open with Mayank Agarwal for India in the third Test against Australia, which will commence on December 26. ""He has an organised defence and a calm head on his shoulders. And that would free up a slot for a middle-order bat or all-rounder,"" Tharoor tweeted.",Times Now,"Ahead of the third Test slated to kick off in Melbourne on the Boxing Day, the only concern over India's playing XI for the match is the opener's slot. Mayank Agarwal has already been backed by many to make his debut at the MCG, but concern seems to hover around his partner for the game. While few have kept the experienced Murali Vijay beside the debutant, few other options that have popped up include the name of Rohit Sharma and Hanuma Vihari. However, politician Shashi Tharoor has a unique option for the debatable opener's slot for the third Test. Prithvi Shaw seemed to be an ideal option for India ahead of the series kick off, but an unfortunate ankle injury during the practice game put him to the sidelines in the first two Test and later was ruled out of the series.  In the absence of the youngster, Vijay and Rahul compiled 49 runs and 48 runs respectively in the first Two Tests against Australia, while also recording a duck in the Perth Test. The poor performance of the openers urged the management to recall Mayank for the last two Tests. While the 27-year-old was devoid of a chance to make his debut on home turf against West Indies despite making it to the squad, it seems most certainly that Mayank will make his debut next week when the third Test between India and Australia kick off at the MCG. However, there seems to be a bit of doubt over his partner for the match - should it be Vihari or Rohit? And Tharoor opines Ravichandran Ashwin as an option.""The departure of @PrithviShaw is a bigger setback than the Test loss to Australia. Perhaps we should ask @ashwinravi99 to open with Mayank Aggarwal now? He has an organised defence & a calm head on his shoulders. And that wld free up a slot for a middle-order bat or all-rounder,"" tweeted Tharoor.  The departure of @PrithviShaw is a bigger setback than the Test loss to Australia. Perhaps we should ask @ashwinravi99 to open with MayankAggarwal now? He has an organised defence & a calm head on his shoulders. And that wld free up a slot for a middle-order bat or all-rounder. Well, Ashwin does have the experience to play as an opener. He had in fact started out his career in domestic cricket as an opener. Meanwhile, former cricketer Sanjay Manjrekar opined Mayank to open with Murali in Melbourne. ""I will personally still go (open) with Mayank Agarwal and Murali Vijay,"" Manjrekar told IndiaTV.

He added that since shooting at these places can be difficult, they will have to check the possibility of doing so first. ""We will start [shooting] sometime mid-next year,"" Ahmed further said.",Pinkvilla,"After the stupendous success of Baaghi (2016) and Baaghi 2 (2018), reports were rife of a third installment to the film and finally, after months of speculation, the makers of the film have made an official announcement about Baaghi 3. Given the success of Baaghi and Baaghi 2, the expectations from Baaghi 3 are at an all-time high and while Tiger Shroff will return in the role of Ronnie, however, the lead actress is yet to be finalized. While Baaghi was directed by Sabbir Khan, Baaghi 2 was helmed by Ahmed Khan.In an interview to DNA, director of the film, Ahmed Khan, spoke about the buzz around the film and said, “I know there are huge expectations from Baaghi 3. I had designed the action for Baaghi 2. It was the first time a choreographer won an award in this department. Now, I want to amp it up.” While Tiger Shroff will begin shooting for the film after he wraps up Punit Malhotra’s Student of the Year 2 and the untitled film opposite Hrithik Roshan and Vaani Kapoor, the director has already zeroed in on the location and given that Baaghi series is high on action sequences, Ahmed Khan wants to shoot the film in Syria. “Along with the big action pieces, Baaghi series also has an emotional story at its centre. I am going to finish the dramatic scenes first and then get into the action as that may take time. We will start sometime mid-next year. Sajid and I have spoken about it. We want to shoot the film in Syria and Iraq because it requires that kind of terrain. But since shooting at these places can be difficult, we will have to check the possibility of doing so first,” informed Ahmed. Also, Baaghi 3 will see Tiger do some unbelievably crazy stunts and for the same, the director of the film says that Tiger will have to learn how to fly choppers and use heavy artillery. Moreover, Ahmed Khan plans to send Tiger Shroff to various places to learn all forms of combats. Well, looks like Baaghi 3 is going to redefine action in the Indian film industry.  A few days back, the newest student on the block, Tiger Shroff took to Twitter to announce the third installment to Baaghi titled Baaghi 3 and the film will release in 2020 as he wrote, “And round 3 is on! #SajidNadiadwala's #Baaghi3 will be out on 6th March 2020.

Today, France’s data protection watchdog, the CNIL, announced it was fining Uber $460,000 (€400,000).This event was a combination of bad security with bad reaction and good timing. Back in 2016, Uber faced a data breach that affected 57 million users, including 1.4 million users in France.According to the CNIL’s  report, hackers managed to connect to Uber’s GitHub repositories using some employee’s login and password. They then managed to connect to Uber’s Amazon Web Services account and download user data.How? Very simple. AWS login information was stored in plain text on GitHub.Two hackers behind 2016 Uber data breach have been indicted for another hackThe CNIL said that it could have been avoided if:Uber first tried to cover up the breach by paying hackers $100,000 to make them delete the data set. It eventually disclosed the breach last year.The only good news for Uber is that the breach happened slightly too early for European Union’s GDPR. Right now, if a company doesn’t report a breach to relevant authorities within 72 hours, they can end up paying a fine of up to 4 percent of the company’s global annual turnover.British and Dutch authorities previously fined Uber $490,000 and $690,000 respectively (£385,000 and €600,000).

37212,US' Alabama police blames rising crime on people 'rejecting God',"A police department in Alabama, US, has said that crimes have risen as young people ""have turned away from God and embraced Satan"". The statement, written on the department's Facebook page, followed two murders in Covington County in two days and added that five murders had occurred in 2018. The post was removed from the page following a backlash.",RT,"The murders happened ""because we have turned away from God and embraced Satan,"" according to a Facebook post from the Opp Police Department which blamed ""our young people"" for two homicides in two days in Covington County, a district which borders Florida and contains the 6,500-person town of Opp. There have been five murders in Covington County this year.""It is time to ask for God's help to stop this,"" the post continued, calling on parents to step up and raise their kids (""not have them raise us"") and support law enforcement. ""Bottom line, there are sheep; there are wolves, and there are sheep dogs. Which group do you belong to?"" ends the impassioned all-caps call-to-arms.After receiving ""multiple citizen complaints"" about the post, the Freedom From Religion Foundation sent the department a letter reminding them it is illegal for a government body to engage in ""promotion and rejection of specific religious beliefs."" The group asked the Opp PD to remove the offending language and avoid posting religious content in the future.""By including religious messages in this otherwise important post, the department sends a message to those who do not believe in 'GOD' that they are not 'favored members of the political community,"" FFRF wrote, pointing out that ""the First Amendment prohibits even the appearance of religious endorsement by government officials.""All legal matters aside, the letter continued, the claim that embracing God will lower murder rates is just plain wrong. The FFRF claimed the world's most secular countries actually have lower violent crime rates and higher standards of living – a pattern they say can be found within US states as well, singling out Vermont and Oregon as states with low murder rates as opposed to the highly-religious Louisiana and, yes, Alabama.As of Thursday, the post appears to have been removed from the departmental Facebook page but is attached to the FFRF's letter.

SoftBank had first bought a stake worth $250 million in Grab in 2014. Founded in 2012, the Singapore-based startup has raised over $6.5 billion till date.",TechCrunch,"SoftBank’s  Vision Fund is set to continue its recent spree of investments in Asian tech unicorns. The mega fund — which is targeted at $100 billion — is planning to invest upwards of $1 billion into Southeast Asia’s ride-hailing leader Grab, two sources with knowledge of the plan told TechCrunch. The investment could reach as much as $1.5 billion, one source added.A SoftBank representative did not respond to a request for comment. Grab  declined to comment.The Vision Fund has made significant investments in three billion-dollar Asian companies in recent months. That includes backing India’s OYO as part of a $1 billion round (which included money from Grab) in September, writing a $2 billion check for Korea’s Coupang in November and co-leading a $1.2 billion round for Tokopedia in Indonesia alongside Alibaba earlier this month.There is a pattern that SoftBank appears to be following here.In all three cases, the Japanese company was an existing investor and, having transferred its stakes to the Vision Fund, it then doubled down and invested again via the Vision Fund itself. That’s also the plan for this Grab deal, TechCrunch understands.SoftBank’s most recent financial report, filed in November, explains that it plans to move its stakes in ride-hailing firms Uber, China’s Didi, India’s Ola and Grab over to the Vision Fund. But that hasn’t happened yet and it isn’t clear when it will.“The Company expects that the necessary procedures will be made in the future to obtain applicable consent from limited partners of the Fund and regulatory approvals for the transfer,” it explained in the report, which doesn’t include a projected time frame.One source told TechCrunch that the investment in Grab is contingent on that equity transfer being made, as was the case with Tokopedia and Coupang, which saw SoftBank-owned stakes transferred to the fund in Q3 of this year.Grab CEO and co-founder Anthony Tan [Photographer: Ore Huiying/Bloomberg/Getty Images]While we don’t know how long that wait will be, Grab is hardly short on cash. The Singapore-based company is putting the final touches to its Series H fund which is focused on raising a total of $3 billion. It has already received significant contributions from Toyota, Microsoft, Yamaha Motors, Booking Holdings and a range of institutional investors.Grab CEO and co-founder Anthony Tan [Photographer: Ore Huiying/Bloomberg/Getty Images]Grab operates across eight markets in Southeast Asia, where it claims over 130 million downloads and more than 2.5 billion completed rides to date. The company acquired Uber’s business earlier this year in a deal that saw the U.S. company pick up a 27.5 percent stake in Grab and turn their rivalry into a partnership. The merger deal, however, was criticized by regulators and, in Singapore, the pair were fined a total of $9.5 million for violating anti-competition laws.Grab is Southeast Asia’s highest-valued tech startup, having commanded an $11 billion valuation through this Series H round. It isn’t clear how much that figure will increase if/when this Vision Fund investment closes. The company has raised around $6.8 billion to date from investors, according to data from Crunchbase.",https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/20/softbank-vision-fund-grab-1-billion/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,

37245,Ousted Nissan Chairman re-arrested in Japan while still in jail,Ousted Nissan Chairman Carlos Ghosn was re-arrested by Japanese authorities on Friday on suspicion that he shifted over $16 million in personal losses to Nissan. Ghosn has been held in jail for over a month for allegedly understating his income by $80 million in 2011-2018. The re-arrest gives prosecutors the right to detain him for at least another 10 days.,Reuters,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese prosecutors arrested Nissan Motor Co Ltd’s (7201.T) ousted chairman Carlos Ghosn again on Friday on new allegations of making Nissan shoulder $16.6 million in personal investment losses, dashing chances he would be released on bail before Christmas. Prosecutors also raided Ghosn’s residence in Tokyo on Friday in search of evidence, broadcaster TV Asahi reported. The latest twist in a saga that has jolted the global auto industry and Nissan’s alliance with France’s Renault SA (RENA.PA) came a day after a Tokyo court unexpectedly rejected prosecutors’ request to extend Ghosn’s detention. That rejection had raised the possibility that the prominent businessman could go free on bail as early as Friday. The re-arrest, however, means he could be detained for at least another 10 days in a Tokyo jail, where he has been confined since he was arrested last month on initial allegations of financial misconduct.  The Tokyo prosecutor said the fresh arrest was based on suspicions that around October 2008, Ghosn shifted personal trades to the automaker to make it responsible for 1.85 billion yen ($16.6 million) in appraisal losses, and inflicted damage on Nissan by having it deposit a total of $14.7 million on four occasions between June 2009 and March 2012 into a related bank account.  His lawyer, Motonari Otsuru, was not available for comment. Otsuru has previously declined to return calls about the Ghosn case. Kyodo news agency said that when the allegation that Ghosn had shifted the paper losses first surfaced in media reports late last month, Otsuru said his client had denied it. Ghosn had considered the move but did not do so after being told by financial authorities that it would be illegal, Kyodo quoted Otsuru as saying then. Also on Friday, the Tokyo court said in a statement that the lawyer for Ghosn’s former deputy Greg Kelly, who was arrested along with Ghosn, has requested his client’s release. Kelly’s detention extension was rejected along with Ghosn’s. The lawyer, Yoichi Kitamura, later told Reuters that Kelly was unlikely to be released before Tuesday because there was not enough time to complete procedures, including the payment of any bail that might be set. The dramatic turn of events came hours after Ghosn, through his lawyer and quoted by Japanese public broadcaster NHK, vowed to restore his good name in court and to hold a news conference after his release. “Things as they stand are absolutely unacceptable,” he was quoted as saying. “I want to have my position heard and restore my honor in court.” Television camera crews had gathered outside the Tokyo jail on Friday morning in hopes of catching sight of Ghosn being released. Ghosn was initially arrested on Nov. 19 for allegedly understating his income by about half over a five-year period from 2010. He was later re-arrested for a similar alleged crime covering the past three years. The maximum penalty for both understating compensation and the latest accusation - aggravated breach of trust - is up to 10 years in prison and/or a fine of 10 million yen. Nissan said after his initial arrest that it unearthed multiple instances of possible wrongdoing in an internal investigation triggered by a whistleblower.  The internal probe is ongoing, and has included allegations of diverting company funds to pay for personal expenses. Sources have told Reuters that investigators have been looking into the use of an internal “CEO Reserve” fund and the role of overseas subsidiaries in alleged financial misconduct. The Ghosn case has put Japan’s criminal justice system under international scrutiny and sparked criticism for some of its practices, including keeping suspects in detention for long periods and prohibiting defense lawyers from being present during interrogations, which can last eight hours a day. The case also marked a dramatic fall for the leader of the Nissan-Renault-Mitsubishi Motors Corp (7211.T) alliance who was once hailed for rescuing Nissan from the brink of bankruptcy. Nissan Chief Executive Hiroto Saikawa has since called for changes to weaken the clout of controlling shareholder Renault. Documents seen by Reuters showed that some discussions about compensating Ghosn out of the public eye were not confined to Nissan, but also included Renault executives. While Nissan ousted Ghosn from his role as chairman shortly after the initial arrest, Renault has so far not replaced him. A Nissan spokesman declined to comment on the re-arrest, saying only that the internal investigation was ongoing and expanding into new areas. Renault declined to comment.

37247,US ignored Pak's nuclear proliferation to counter India: Docs,"The US ignored Pakistan's nuclear proliferation in the 1970-80s to counter India's nuclear weapons, declassified documents showed. The then Pakistani dictator General Zia-ul-Haq and Chinese Vice Premier Deng Xiaoping convinced the US over aid to Pakistan, claiming India would be pro-Soviet. The US also ignored Pakistan's nuclear programme to gain its support against Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.",The New Indian Express,"WASHINGTON: The US acceded to Pakistan's demand, supported by China, to ""set aside"" its concerns over Islamabad's secretive nuclear weapons programme in the immediate aftermath of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, according to the latest documents declassified from the era.The documents, which were released by the State Department, reveal that then Pakistani dictator General Zia-ul Haq and Chinese Vice Premier Deng Xiaoping were successful in extracting this price from the US in lieu of Islamabad's support to America against the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.In addition to the US turning a blind eye to Pakistan's nuclear weapons programme, Deng also convinced the US to start giving more military and financial aid to Pakistan, according to the US Foreign Relations 1977-1980 volume on Afghanistan.The voluminous document indicates that both Zia and Deng successfully convinced the then Carter administration that India under former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi would be pro-Soviet.""There are limits on our ability to aid Pakistan because of their nuclear explosive programme.Although we still object to their doing so, we will now set that aside for the time being, to facilitate strengthening Pakistan against potential Soviet action,"" the then US Defense Secretary Harold Brown said in a January 8, 1980 meeting with Deng.Deng applauded the US decision as he was successfully able to convince the Carter administration on this issue.""That is a very good approach. Pakistan has its own reasons for developing a nuclear programme. We ourselves oppose the Pakistan effort on nuclear weapons because we believe it meaningless to spend money on such a programme,"" he said.""Pakistan has its own arguments, ie, India has exploded a nuclear device but the world has not seemed to complain about this.So now you have decided to put this aside and solve the question of military and economic aid to Pakistan. We applaud this decision,"" Deng said.He also convinced the US to not equate India and Pakistan when it comes to giving aid.""You may recall that I raised the question of aid to Pakistan with President Carter. He said the US will give aid in proportion to the population of the two countries. I said this was not feasible,"" Deng told Brown referring to his conversation with Carter.""The Pakistanis and Indians are afraid of each other. If the population ratio formula should be used, Pakistan will be in an increasingly inferior position.We hope that since the United States decided to give aid to Pakistan, it will really satisfy Pakistan's requirements.We hope your aid to Pakistan will not be affected too much by India's reaction,"" Deng said.""With regard to question of South Asia, there is no other way except giving aid to Pakistan.It has always been our view that the US policy giving more attention to India than Pakistan is not an appropriate policy.""Regarding India, we have always felt that the United States should try to cultivate good relations, and this has had a good effect.But India is not a stabilising factor. Perhaps you already know the general election results,"" Deng said.He was referring to the then just-concluded parliamentary elections in which Indira Gandhi came back to power with a majority.Observing that Gandhi had got 70 per cent of the vote, Deng said it was very difficult to judge that time how India will go.""Even if Indira Gandhi should follow India's previous policy; still India is not the most reliable and stabilising factor in southern Asia,"" he argued.""Let's not talk about Indira Gandhi. The present government is thinking of recognising the Heng Samrin Regime.Perhaps after Pakistan has been strengthened, India will become a more stabilising factor.What one should try to achieve is to make Pakistan a genuine stabilising factor in South Asia,"" he said.""We hope the United States will give earnest and sincere thought to this question.If one does not keep this clear in one's mind, then one's attitude toward India will make one vacillate in one's position toward Pakistan.""In the past the United States has refrained from aiding Pakistan.I think in part this is the work of India, probably because of a fear of offending India.Since you now have decided to aid Pakistan, I am sure India will send you one note after another, strongly objecting,"" Deng said.Around 10 days before Gandhi was sworn in as the new Prime Minister of India on January 14, 1980, Zia had a meeting with the then US Ambassador to Pakistan in which he successfully bargained for the US to keep an eye off its nuclear weapons programme in lieu of its support for America against the Russian invasion in Afghanistan.President Carter's statement of January 4 ""gives impression that nuclear issue need not be an obstacle and Pakistan needs to know precisely what America proposes to do to help Pakistan"" Haq is quoted as saying in a readout of the meeting.In October, when Zia visited the US, President Carter offered F-16 to Pakistan.Zia asked for six more planes in addition to increase in the military aid.""The freedom fighters need more anti-tank and anti-helicopter weapons (discussion of some defective SA7s). France has good weapons and the Europeans should be more helpful,"" he said.""On another issue, I just want to say that Mrs Gandhi is no friend of Pakistan or the US,"" he told Carter. ",http://www.newindianexpress.com/world/2018/dec/21/us-set-aside-its-nuclear-proliferation-concerns-of-pakistan-for-support-in-afghanistan-reveal-docum-1914298.html?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,

Asia's richest person Mukesh Ambani added $4 billion to his fortune.",Bloomberg Quint,"(Bloomberg) -- The world’s fastest growing source of mega-wealth hit a speed bump this year.The 128 people in Asia with enough money to crack the 500-member Bloomberg Billionaires Index lost a combined $137 billion in 2018, the first time wealth in the region has dropped since the ranking started in 2012.Global trade tensions and concerns that stock valuations are too frothy hammered some of the area’s biggest fortunes. China’s tech sector was hit particularly hard, while India and South Korea weren’t spared. The declines occurred even as banks and money managers aggressively stepped up efforts to cater to Asia’s richest. Asian equities retreated again on Friday, with benchmarks slipping in Japan, China and Australia.“Difficult stock market conditions this year and the uncertainty of the trade tensions likely have been a challenge to many businesses,” said Philip Wyatt, a Hong Kong-based economist for UBS Group AG, who doesn’t see the downdraft continuing through 2019 or significantly reducing the ranks of billionaires. Conditions are actually ripe for the region to create more of the mega rich as new technologies attract private capital and government support, he said.For now, though, fear in the market is trampling fortunes. More than two-thirds of the 40 Chinese on the Bloomberg ranking saw their wealth dwindle. Wanda Group’s Wang Jianlin, whose property conglomerate is selling assets to cut debt, lost $10.8 billion, the most of anyone in Asia. JD.com founder Richard Liu, who was arrested in the U.S. in August for less than 24 hours on suspicion of rape before being released, took the heaviest losses in percentage terms, with his wealth cut almost in half to $4.8 billion. Liu won’t be charged, authorities in Minneapolis said Friday.India’s 23 richest people, meanwhile, saw $21 billion vanish. Lakshmi Mittal, who controls the world’s largest steelmaker, led the way, losing $5.6 billion, or 29 percent of his net worth, followed by Dilip Shanghvi, the founder of Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, the world’s fourth-largest generic drugmaker, whose wealth declined $4.6 billion.South Korea’s tycoons didn’t escape the carnage either. The market rout lopped $17.2 billion from the fortunes of the country’s seven richest people. The father and son who control Samsung Electronics, Lee Kun-Hee and son Jay Y Lee, account for more than a third of that decline.In Hong Kong, titans of real estate took a big hit. Li Ka-shing, who retired as chairman of CK Hutchison and CK Asset in March, lost $6 billion in 2018, while Lee Shau Kee, the city’s second-richest person, ends the year about $3.3 billion poorer.There were still plenty of winners to emerge from the wreckage of 2018.Lei Jun, the chairman of Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi Corp., added $8.7 billion, with a July initial public offering catapulting him into the Top 100 of the Bloomberg index after he started the year outside the ranking. The IPO also turned three of his co-founders into billionaires.Japan’s richest person, Tadashi Yanai, added $6.3 billion to his fortune as shares of Fast Retailing Co., the world’s largest apparel retailer, surged 30 percent. India’s Mukesh Ambani added $4 billion to his fortune and eclipsed Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.’s Jack Ma as Asia’s richest person, thanks in part to the performance of Reliance Industries Ltd.Among the winners, the Bloomberg Billionaires Index added new members in technology, consumer, biotech and pharmaceuticals.At least six Asian billionaires died, leaving behind a total of $29 billion.©2018 Bloomberg L.P.",https://www.bloombergquint.com/markets/asia-s-mega-rich-take-a-hit-with-137-billion-in-losses-in-2018?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,

The social media giant's first focus will reportedly be India, the world's largest remittances market as per World Bank. The financial institution had revealed people sent $69 billion home to India in 2017.",BGR,"Facebook and its privacy problems do not seem to have an end, just not yet. But that does not mean the company is stopping from developing new features for its services. According to Bloomberg, the social media giant is working on making a cryptocurrency that will allow its users to transfer money on its WhatsApp messaging application.The company has been working on a form of cryptocurrency for sometime now and has even escalated David Marcus to the role of exploring blockchain. Now, Bloomberg reports that Facebook is developing a stablecoin that will minimize volatility seen with other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. The social media company is far from releasing the coin and is said to be still working on the strategy. It is is planning for custody assets or regular currencies that would be held to protect the value of its stablecoin, sources familiar with Facebook’s plan told the publication.These efforts are being led by Marcus himself, who was elevated from his lead role running Messenger app to head of company’s blockchain initiatives. The report says Facebook has been on a hiring spree and now counts about 40 people in the blockchain group.“Like many other companies, Facebook is exploring ways to leverage the power of blockchain technology. This new small team is exploring many different applications. We don’t have anything further to share,” a company spokesman told Bloomberg in a statement.Facebook wants to use its stablecoin as a means of exchanging money on WhatsApp, the social messaging app used by over 1.5 billion people around the world. The service is popular in India, where it is estimated to have over 250 million users and working on launching UPI-based payment solutions for all of its users. Facebook is also encouraged by the fact that India leads the world in remittances, where people sent $69 billion home to India in 2017, according to data from the World Bank.In the past year, the number of projects surrounding stablecoins have gone up significantly. The concept is meant to create a digital coin that would be easier to use on a daily basis that something like a bitcoin.

""I had the opportunity to stop it and I didn't do it and that was my leadership failure,"" Smith added.",Cricket Australia,"Suspended Australia batsman Steve Smith has opened up about the ""dark days"" since the Cape Town ball-tampering scandal and praised the leadership of his successor and Test skipper Tim Paine.On Friday, Smith spoke to the media for the first time on Australian soil since his tearful press conference immediately after he returned home from South Africa, revealing there have been days where he hasn't wanted to get out of bed.But nine months on, the 29-year-old said he's in good spirits due to the strong support of close friends and family.""I’m going OK,"" Smith said at the SCG.""I’ve had tough days, I’ve had my ups and downs. But I’ve been really fortunate to have a close group of people around me to help me through those difficult times.""There have been some dark days where I haven’t wanted to get out of bed and things like that.""But I’ve had a close group of people around me to help me know that it’s OK.""I’ve made a mistake and it was a big mistake and I’m trying to move on from that and improve as a person.""Smith's 12-month ban, for his involvement in the plan to deliberately use a foreign object – sandpaper – to artificially alter the condition of the ball in the third Test against South Africa in Cape Town this year, concludes at the end of next March.While serving his ban, the right-hander has played in T20 competitions in Canada and the Caribbean, featured for Sutherland in NSW Premier (club) Cricket and has batted in the nets against Australia's Test pace trio Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood and Pat Cummins.While he has been on the sidelines, Australia have endured mixed results on the field.The ODI team was whitewashed in England and lost to the Proteas on home soil, the T20 side lost in the final of the tri-series in Zimbabwe and later drew with India at home, while the Test outfit played valiantly in a losing cause in the UAE and only this week levelled the series against Virat Kohli's India. Smith said it's been tough watching his former teammates struggle knowing he cannot help them with a match-winning performance like has done so often in the past.But Smith praised Australia for their 146-run win at Perth Stadium and the captaincy of Paine, who was made interim captain in the wakes of the Newlands episode before being handed the top job on a full-time basis.""It’s been tough (watching) at times, particularly when the boys haven’t played their best in a couple of games,"" he said.""It’s been hard watching and knowing that I can’t go out and help them.""But I was really proud of the way the boys played last week in Perth.""I thought they were magnificent and I think Tim Paine’s leadership has been exceptional since taking over as captain.""He’s obviously been faced with difficult circumstances to begin with but he’s done a terrific job.""Australia's first assignment after his ban lifts will be the 2019 Cricket World Cup and the Ashes in the UK.Smith outlined his playing schedule between now and the start of the World Cup but is not expecting to walk back into the national side as soon as he becomes eligible.Should he be picked in Australia's World Cup or Ashes squads, or both, Smith is ready for a frosty reception from the English crowds.""Hopefully (I will) get another opportunity to play for Australia,"" he said. ""And if that’s in a World Cup and Ashes, so be it.""No doubt the English crowd will be incredibly hostile and I’m ready for that if that was to happen. Nothing’s for certain, I’ll keep working hard and if I get that opportunity again that’ll be great.""One thing I’ve always done pretty well is blocking out exterior noise and getting on with the job.""No doubt the Barmy Army are loud and you can’t block out as much but it’s about staying in your own mind and not letting distractions take you over.""Smith had been expecting to feature in this year's Bangladesh Premier League, but has been barred from the competition on technical grounds, but will continue his globe-trotting T20 ways in the lead up to his suspension expiring.""I was playing in the Bangladesh league … then there’s the PSL and the IPL, which I think is adequate preparation for the World Cup if I’m selected,"" Smith said.""The way the one-day game is playing it’s almost an extended T20 so T20 cricket is a good way to prepare.""While Smith was banned for 12 months, he cannot hold a leadership position in Australian cricket for two years from the time the penalty was levelled.He was asked whether he had future captaincy ambitions but said for the moment his focus is returning to the national team. ""I just want to get back playing and try and contribute to the team as much as I can and just help out anyone who is around, Tim (Paine) and Finchy  (limited-overs skipper Aaron Finch) as well. We’ll see what the future holds.""But at the moment I'm just preparing to play and I'm excited by that prospect.""Between his club cricket duties, Smith has been working with radio identity Gus Worland as part of Gotcha4Life to help raise the awareness of mental health and help save the lives on men and boys in Australia.""The number of suicides in Australia is far too high; six men and two women a day for 25 million people or thereabouts, I think it's unacceptable,"" he said.""I'm trying to do what I can to create that awareness around it and that's what the campaign is about.""If you or someone you know needs support, visit https://www.beyondblue.org.au/",https://www.cricket.com.au/news/steve-smith-breaks-silence-scg-press-conference-ball-tampering-mental-health-suicide-awareness/2018-12-21?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,

The blocked words are not limited to English and include words in Hindi and other languages.Search keyword block will not stop offenders from uploading such content at the source, but it will stop the videos from going viral.

37304,Denmark passes law making handshake must for citizenship,"Danish lawmakers have approved a government-backed proposal to make citizenship applicants shake hands with the official conducting the naturalisation ceremony. The lawmakers argued the gesture, criticised for discriminating against Muslims, represents a mark of respect for the government. The law would come into effect on January 1, however, some mayors said they will ignore the new guidelines.",RT,"The new citizenship bill has been the subject of a heated debate since last summer. It requires those applying for Danish citizenship to commit to the country’s values and to show respect for its government by shaking hands with its representative.Critics of the bill argue that it’s aimed at discouraging Muslims from seeking Danish citizenship, calling the proposal discriminatory and describing it as an unnecessary formality.The proposal was backed by Denmark’s three-party minority government, with the driving force behind the legislation being the Conservative Party and anti-immigrant Danish People’s Party.The changes to the naturalization ceremony, which come into effect on January 1, have been met with strong opposition from the local officials who conduct such proceedings. Some mayors have already said they will ignore the new guidelines. The mayor of the town of Kerteminde in central Denmark has gone so far as to imply that he would rather not show up at work than coerce an applicant to shake his hand.“Shaking hands does not show if you are integrated or not. I think I will probably find an excuse and the deputy mayor will come to work that day,” Kasper Ejsing Olesen told the Guardian earlier.READ MORE: Cheat, lie and abuse – Danish immigration minister hits out at migrantsThe red tape associated with the festive ceremony will cost taxpayers an additional 2,400 kroner ($370) – double the current fee of 1,200 kroner ($183).

I think it is a tremendously large and valuable gift,” People’s Party spokesman Christian Langball told a local broadcaster in September, as cited by the Local.Denmark’s Integration Minister Inger Stojberg, a member of the center-right Venstre party, brushed off the criticism, insisting that a handshake is “a completely natural part of the ceremony.”Stojberg said that a spokesman for Hizb ut-Tahrir, an Islamic group that openly supports the establishment of a caliphate, told her that he would not have become a Danish citizen if the rules applied retroactively.“I asked him if he would advise his followers in Hizb ut-Tahrir to pass on it, and he said he would. And that’s exactly what we want with the naturalization ceremony,” the minister said, as cited by TV2.The latest measure is another step in the Danish government’s wide-ranging crackdown on migration. Earlier this month, Stojberg proposed sending rejected asylum seekers to a remote island, about two miles from the mainland. Some 100 failed asylum seekers and criminal migrants are going to be brought to the islet in the Baltic Sea on a ferry under the plan. In August, hundreds hit the streets to protest against a “burqa ban” – another “discriminatory” measure that came into effect that month.Denmark has also been enforcing a controversial law allowing authorities to confiscate cash and valuables from refugees to fund their stay in Denmark since 2016. ",https://www.rt.com/news/447104-denmark-handshake-law-citizenship/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,
37305,"US to withdraw over 5,000 troops from Afghanistan: Report","US President Donald Trump is planning to withdraw over 5,000 of the 14,000 American troops in Afghanistan, according to a US official. The reports come a day after Trump announced the withdrawal of American troops from Syria. The American troops in Afghanistan are involved in the fight against the Taliban and other militant groups, as well as training Afghan forces.",Reuters,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump is planning to withdraw more than 5,000 of the 14,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan, a U.S. official said on Thursday, in the latest sign Trump’s patience is thinning with America’s longest war and overseas military interventions. On Wednesday, Trump rebuffed top advisers and decided to pull all U.S. troops out of Syria, a decision that contributed  to U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis abruptly quitting on Thursday over significant policy differences with the president. One official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said a decision had been made and verbal orders had been given to start planning for the drawdown. The official said timelines were being discussed but it could happen in weeks or months. It is unclear how the United States with less than 9,000 forces in Afghanistan will be able to fulfill the full set of missions now underway, including training Afghan forces, advising them in the field, and waging an air campaign against the Taliban and other militant groups.  Instead, the United States almost certainly would have to curtail its missions, something that could provide an opportunity for a resurgent Taliban to expand their offensives across Afghanistan. Mattis had argued for maintaining a strong U.S. military presence in Afghanistan to bolster diplomatic peace efforts. He resigned shortly after U.S. officials raised the possibility that Trump would order the drawdown.  The decision on Syria has bewildered U.S. allies and triggered harsh reaction from Trump’s fellow Republicans in Congress.  The Pentagon declined to comment on Afghanistan. Garrett Marquis, a spokesman for the National Security Council, said the White House would not comment “on future strategic developments.” The United States went to war in Afghanistan in 2001 in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, seeking to oust the Taliban militants harboring Saudi-raised militant Osama bin Laden, who led plans to carry out the attacks. U.S. officials are currently engaged in talks with the Taliban, who now control a significant amount of territory. The Taliban insurgency has strengthened its grip over the past three years, with the government in Kabul controlling just 56 percent of Afghanistan, down from 72 percent in 2015, a U.S. government report showed. Trump privately has been grousing about U.S. military involvement in Afghanistan, telling an ally as recently as Wednesday words to the effect of, “What are we doing there? We’ve been there all these years.” The source, who asked to remain unidentified, said it appeared the president “has lost all patience” with the U.S. military presence in Afghanistan. More than 2,400 U.S. forces have died in the 17-year-old war in Afghanistan, and Pentagon officials have repeatedly warned that a precipitous exit would allow militants to develop new plots on America. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, often a vocal Trump ally, warned of possible danger to the United States if the drawdown goes through. “The conditions in Afghanistan - at the present moment - make American troop withdrawals a high risk strategy. If we continue on our present course we are setting in motion the loss of all our gains and paving the way toward a second 9/11,” Graham said in a statement. Trump last year approved an increase in U.S. troops but acknowledged that he did so reluctantly.  Late last month, at least 22 Afghan police were killed in a Taliban ambush in Afghanistan’s western province of Farah, adding to the growing casualty toll on Afghan security forces. Earlier this week, U.S. special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad and Taliban representatives held talks in Abu Dhabi on a deal that would end the war. Officials from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates also took part.  The Saudi ambassador to Washington, Khalid bin Salman, tweeted on Thursday that the discussions had been productive and would bring “very positive results by the beginning of next year.” But a former senior State Department official familiar with the issue said that the Taliban representatives rejected a proposal by Khalilzad for a ceasefire and demanded that the talks focus on a U.S. withdrawal.

The strike was called by the All India Bank Officers' Confederation, which has over 20 lakh members. The United Forum of Bank Unions also called a strike on December 26.",Reuters,"MUMBAI (Reuters) - Workers at India’s state-owned banks called a nationwide strike on Friday in protest at proposed mergers that could cause job losses and demanded immediate wage rises. The strike, by the All India Bank Officers’ Confederation (AIBOC), impacted trading volumes in foreign exchange and debt markets, said traders. Private sector banks were not affected by the strike. AIBOC has a membership of over two million officers and affiliates in all major state-run banks and 10 private banks. The striking officers are responsible for daily operations, causing a complete shutdown of services to customers. The 21 state lenders hold two-thirds of India’s banking assets and account for the bulk of the record $150 billion of soured loans in the banking sector last year. The United Forum of Bank Unions (UFBU), an umbrella body of the top nine bank unions in the country, also decided to hold a strike on December 26 against the proposed merger of Bank of Baroda, Dena Bank and Vijaya Bank. India earlier this year announced plans to merge the three state-run banks to create India’s third-largest bank as part of efforts to clean up the banking system, which has been overburdened by bad debts. The bank unions say they fear the mergers will lead to job cuts and allow private sector banks to dominate the industry. AIBOC Joint General Secretary Ravinder Gupta said the unions are demanding wage revisions based on minimum mandated wages by the government and not asking for it to be linked to profitability of the banks or their paying capacity, which could be higher.

The party said the BJP has not woken up despite its recent electoral defeats in three states and is not ready to learn from what RSS Sarsanghchalak Mohan Bhagwat has to say in the context of teachings of the Bhagavad Gita (the Hindu scripture).There is pressure within the BJP to construct the Ram temple in Ayodhya, but when will ""achhe din"" (good days) come for Lord Ram, the Sena asked.""Shree (Mohan) Bhagwat, while citing the Bhagavad Gita says what is the use of the arrogance (by saying) what 'I' do is the best.

37320,Army deployed as drones shut down UK's second-biggest airport,"The Army was deployed at the UK's second-biggest airport, the Gatwick Airport in London, after drones caused the airport to shut down for more than a day. Thousands of passengers remain stranded as several flights were diverted or cancelled. Gatwick's runway reopened on Friday, with a limited number of aircraft scheduled for departure and arrival.",Reuters,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain sent troops to its second-biggest airport after an unprecedented attempt to cripple Christmas travel with large drones forced all flights to be canceled on Thursday. As thousands of passengers waited at Gatwick Airport, south of London, police hunted unsuccessfully for the operators of the large drones which reappeared near the airfield every time the airport tried to reopen the runway. Police said there was no indication of a terrorism motive behind the devices, which first appeared on Wednesday night.  “The assessment earlier on today was that we wouldn’t be using firearms,” Detective Chief Superintendent Jason Tingley said late on Thursday. “This is continually reviewed so you will know and have seen that we have firearm officers deployed.” Europe’s air traffic control agency Eurocontrol said the airport would remain closed until 0600 GMT on Friday. The armed forces were also deployed to help resolve the situation.  “We are there to assist and do everything we can,” Defence Minister Gavin Williamson told reporters.  Drones were seen as recently as the last hour, a Gatwick spokesman said at about 2200 GMT on Thursday, more than 24 hours after their first sighting. The airport said flights would remain shut down for the rest of the evening on a day when 115,000 people were scheduled to pass through, many en route to seasonal breaks. Prime Minister Theresa May’s spokesman condemned the standoff as “irresponsible and completely unacceptable”.  Passenger Ani Kochiashvili had been bound for Georgia but spent six hours overnight sitting on a plane with her children. “I’m very annoyed because I’m with two kids, a three-month-old and three-year-old,” she told Reuters by phone among thousands camped in the terminal.  “They require a lot of space and food and changing and all that, and the airport is crazy busy so it’s challenging.”  Flights were halted at 2103 GMT on Wednesday after two drones were spotted near the airfield, triggering the biggest disruption at Gatwick since a volcanic ash cloud in 2010. Police said more than 20 units were hunting the operators near Gatwick airport, 50 km (30 miles) south of London. Transport minister Chris Grayling said it was clearly a deliberate act. “This is a commercial-sized drone,” he said. “Every time Gatwick tries to re-open the runway, the drones reappear.” Grayling temporarily lifted night-flying restrictions at other airports to ease congestion caused by diverted aircraft, Sky News reported. With a surge in public enthusiasm for drones, there has been an increase in near-collisions by unmanned aircraft and commercial jets in recent years.  The number of near misses between private drones and aircraft in Britain more than tripled between 2015 and 2017, with 92 incidents recorded last year, according to the UK Airprox Board regulator.  Richard Parker, head of air traffic management technology firm Altitude Angel, said this was the first time a major airport had been hit by such a sustained and deliberate incursion into its airspace. “It’s sophisticated, not from a technology side, but it’s organized. People have charged lots of batteries, and are deliberately trying to avoid being caught, probably by driving around to different locations,” he told Reuters.  “It really is unprecedented.” Gatwick’s Chief Operating Officer Chris Woodroofe described one of the drones as a heavy industrial model. “The police advice is that it would be dangerous to seek to shoot the drone down because of what may happen to the stray bullets,” he told BBC radio. Drone expert Peter Lee of Portsmouth University said he and others had been anticipating disruption.  “One of my concerns about today is that it may well encourage copy-cat incidents because you can achieve a high amount of disruption for a very, very low cost,” he said. It is illegal to fly drones within 1 km (0.6 mile) of a British airport boundary, punishable by five years in prison. Even after Gatwick re-opens, the backlog and disruption are expected to last for days. Gatwick said it was working with its airlines, the biggest of which also include British Airways (ICAG.L) and Norwegian (NWC.OL), on recovery plans once the runway re-opens.  Safety was its “foremost priority”, it said.

37323,US defence chief quits a day after Trump's Syria withdrawal order,"US Defence Secretary James Mattis on Thursday resigned, a day after President Donald Trump decided to pull all US troops out of Syria saying ISIS has been defeated there. You have a right to a Secretary of Defense whose views are better aligned with yours on these and other subjects, Mattis said in a letter to Trump.",Reuters,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis abruptly said he was quitting on Thursday after falling out with President Donald Trump over his foreign policies, including surprise decisions to yank troops from Syria and start planning a drawdown in Afghanistan.  Mattis announced plans to depart in a candid resignation letter to Trump that laid bare the growing divide between them, and implicitly criticized Trump for failing to value America’s closest allies, who fought alongside the United States in both conflicts. He released the letter after a face-to-face meeting with Trump in which the two men also aired their differences, a senior White House official said.  “Because you have a right to a Secretary of Defense whose views are better aligned with yours on these and other subjects, I believe it is right for me to step down from my position,” Mattis said in the letter. U.S. officials said the resignation had not been forced by Trump. Trump announced on Wednesday that U.S. troops in Syria would be withdrawn, a decision that upended American policy in the region. On Thursday, an official said the president was planning to withdraw at least 5,000 of the 14,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan - another blow to Mattis, who advocated for a strong U.S. military presence to bolster diplomatic peace efforts. Mattis, a retired Marine general whose embrace of NATO and America’s traditional alliances often put him at odds with Trump had advised against the Syria withdrawal. One official said it was a contributing factor to his resignation. The news is certain to shock U.S. military allies, already bewildered by what they see as Trump’s unpredictable, go-it-alone approach to global security, and raises questions about whether Mattis’ successor will be as steadfast about traditional treaty commitments, including to NATO. When Mattis interviewed with Trump for the job in 2016, he split with the president-elect on a host of issues, including on NATO and the use of torture. Trump ultimately deferred to Mattis, who opposed the latter, signaling that he could be persuaded by his advisers.  But as time grew, Trump increasingly acted on his own instincts on a host of national security issues, choosing an “America First” agenda that contradicted Mattis’ core beliefs. Mattis’ letter indicated that he disagreed with Trump’s isolationist policies, writing that it was his belief the United States needed to maintain strong alliances and show allies respect.  Trump has withdrawn the United States from several international agreements since taking office in January 2017. The Mattis resignation letter also said that he believed the United States “must be resolute and unambiguous in our approach to those countries whose strategic interests are increasingly in tension with ours.” He identified Russia and China as countries that “want to shape a world consistent with their authoritarian model.”  Mattis’ resignation was greeted with regret on Capitol Hill, by both Republicans and Democrats. U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell indicated he was in agreement with Mattis on America’s alliances and on Russia, whom he described as a foe. “But I am particularly distressed that he is resigning due to sharp differences with the president on these and other key aspects of America’s global leadership,” McConnell said in a statement. Senator Bob Menendez, the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, called it “a significant loss and a real indication that President Trump’s foreign policy agenda has failed and continues to spiral into chaos.”     The shifts in significant aspects of U.S. foreign policy  and Mattis’ addition to the long list of senior Trump administration figures who have quit or been removed added to the sense of an increasingly unpredictable White House as Trump approaches the halfway point of his four-year term.  And if defense policy disagreements were not enough distraction for a president who is under investigation by a special counsel over Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election, financial markets took a beating this week and a U.S. government shutdown loomed because of funding disputes over Trump’s desire to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. This year has been the worst for world stock markets since the 2008 global financial crisis, with MSCI’s 47-country world stocks index down 10 percent.     Trump, announcing Mattis’ departure on Twitter, said he would nominate a successor soon.  “General Jim Mattis will be retiring, with distinction, at the end of February, after having served my Administration as Secretary of Defense for the past two years,” he said. One possible candidate to replace Mattis as defense chief could be Republican Senator Tom Cotton, long considered a front-runner to eventually take the role.  Trump’s White House has had the highest turnover of senior-level staff of the past five presidents, according to the Brookings Institution think tank. Some departed unceremoniously, such as Trump’s first Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, whom Trump fired via Twitter in March. Speculation that Mattis might not last long in his post grew in October when Republican Trump said in a CBS interview that the general was “sort of a Democrat” and might be leaving. Mattis responded at the time by telling reporters that he had Trump’s full support. Stephen Miller, a senior White House adviser, said Trump was entitled to a Pentagon chief with whom he could agree. “This is an opportunity for the whole country to get a new secretary of defense who will be aligned with the president on these critical issues, whether you’re talking about in Syria, whether you’re talking about across the Middle East in general,” Miller told CNN.

""I don't really care what Shane says...I'm not going to pay attention to him,"" he added. ""People outside can say what they want,"" the pacer further said.",CricTracker,"Australian pace spearhead Mitchell Starc is one of the best left-arm bowlers in the world. However, he has faced several injuries throughout his career and has been out of the team for longer than anyone would’ve liked. Despite playing 140 international matches and creating substantial impact Stac in his 8-year career hasn’t achieved what he had set out to.After having played a lot of cricket, his inconsistent performance has kept him in news for the last couple of years. Former Australia spinner Shane Warne first shared his opinion on Starc in the year 2015 when he talked about Starc’s ‘soft’ body language. But the pacer said that he has nothing to prove to anybody on that.AdvertisementStarc has again been criticised by Warne who is commentating during the Test series between India and Australia. The hosts lost the first Test to India and Starc had scalped 5 wickets there by giving 103 runs in the two innings. Warne was not satisfied with his performance and even wrote about it in the Daily Telegraph.He mentioned that Starc had lost his rhythm and questioned his decision to not feature more domestic cricket as it would’ve helped him get back in form.Australia levelled the series 1-1 at Perth and prior to the match, Warne had stated that Starc might lose his place in the playing XI. That was not to be and Starc, in fact, gave them a really good start in both the innings to finish the game with another five wickets. In the process, he also became only the second left-hander, and 17th player, to take 200 Test wickets for Australia.While talking about the criticism he has faced, the 28-year old shared that he is not at all bothered about that as the team, coach, as well as the captain all, are happy with his performance. He further said that people have been criticizing him right after his debut and these all will not ‘hurt’ him anymore.“He’s been on my back since I made my debut, so I don’t really care what Shane says,” Starc was quoted as saying by Sportsar.“I’m not going to pay attention to him. As long as the coach, the captain, the team and the staff are happy with the role I’m playing and I’m doing that job for the team, that’s what matters to me,” he further added. “People outside can say what they want. They’ve been on my back for eight years, it’s not going to hurt me if they keep going for the next few years anyway.”~ Written by Shruti Banerjee",https://www.crictracker.com/i-dont-care-what-he-says-mitchell-starc-replies-to-shane-warnes-comment/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,
37327,Some days I didn't want to get out of bed: Steve Smith on ban,"Australian cricketer Steve Smith, who is serving a one-year ban over his involvement in a ball-tampering scandal, has said there have been some ""dark days"" when he didn't want to get out of bed. ""I've made a mistake...a big mistake and I'm trying to move on...and improve as a person,"" added Smith, whose ban will end in March next year.",Cricket Australia,"Suspended Australia batsman Steve Smith has opened up about the ""dark days"" since the Cape Town ball-tampering scandal and praised the leadership of his successor and Test skipper Tim Paine.On Friday, Smith spoke to the media for the first time on Australian soil since his tearful press conference immediately after he returned home from South Africa, revealing there have been days where he hasn't wanted to get out of bed.But nine months on, the 29-year-old said he's in good spirits due to the strong support of close friends and family.""I’m going OK,"" Smith said at the SCG.""I’ve had tough days, I’ve had my ups and downs. But I’ve been really fortunate to have a close group of people around me to help me through those difficult times.""There have been some dark days where I haven’t wanted to get out of bed and things like that.""But I’ve had a close group of people around me to help me know that it’s OK.""I’ve made a mistake and it was a big mistake and I’m trying to move on from that and improve as a person.""Smith's 12-month ban, for his involvement in the plan to deliberately use a foreign object – sandpaper – to artificially alter the condition of the ball in the third Test against South Africa in Cape Town this year, concludes at the end of next March.While serving his ban, the right-hander has played in T20 competitions in Canada and the Caribbean, featured for Sutherland in NSW Premier (club) Cricket and has batted in the nets against Australia's Test pace trio Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood and Pat Cummins.While he has been on the sidelines, Australia have endured mixed results on the field.The ODI team was whitewashed in England and lost to the Proteas on home soil, the T20 side lost in the final of the tri-series in Zimbabwe and later drew with India at home, while the Test outfit played valiantly in a losing cause in the UAE and only this week levelled the series against Virat Kohli's India. Smith said it's been tough watching his former teammates struggle knowing he cannot help them with a match-winning performance like has done so often in the past.But Smith praised Australia for their 146-run win at Perth Stadium and the captaincy of Paine, who was made interim captain in the wakes of the Newlands episode before being handed the top job on a full-time basis.""It’s been tough (watching) at times, particularly when the boys haven’t played their best in a couple of games,"" he said.""It’s been hard watching and knowing that I can’t go out and help them.""But I was really proud of the way the boys played last week in Perth.""I thought they were magnificent and I think Tim Paine’s leadership has been exceptional since taking over as captain.""He’s obviously been faced with difficult circumstances to begin with but he’s done a terrific job.""Australia's first assignment after his ban lifts will be the 2019 Cricket World Cup and the Ashes in the UK.Smith outlined his playing schedule between now and the start of the World Cup but is not expecting to walk back into the national side as soon as he becomes eligible.Should he be picked in Australia's World Cup or Ashes squads, or both, Smith is ready for a frosty reception from the English crowds.""Hopefully (I will) get another opportunity to play for Australia,"" he said. ""And if that’s in a World Cup and Ashes, so be it.""No doubt the English crowd will be incredibly hostile and I’m ready for that if that was to happen. Nothing’s for certain, I’ll keep working hard and if I get that opportunity again that’ll be great.""One thing I’ve always done pretty well is blocking out exterior noise and getting on with the job.""No doubt the Barmy Army are loud and you can’t block out as much but it’s about staying in your own mind and not letting distractions take you over.""Smith had been expecting to feature in this year's Bangladesh Premier League, but has been barred from the competition on technical grounds, but will continue his globe-trotting T20 ways in the lead up to his suspension expiring.""I was playing in the Bangladesh league … then there’s the PSL and the IPL, which I think is adequate preparation for the World Cup if I’m selected,"" Smith said.""The way the one-day game is playing it’s almost an extended T20 so T20 cricket is a good way to prepare.""While Smith was banned for 12 months, he cannot hold a leadership position in Australian cricket for two years from the time the penalty was levelled.He was asked whether he had future captaincy ambitions but said for the moment his focus is returning to the national team. ""I just want to get back playing and try and contribute to the team as much as I can and just help out anyone who is around, Tim (Paine) and Finchy  (limited-overs skipper Aaron Finch) as well. We’ll see what the future holds.""But at the moment I'm just preparing to play and I'm excited by that prospect.""Between his club cricket duties, Smith has been working with radio identity Gus Worland as part of Gotcha4Life to help raise the awareness of mental health and help save the lives on men and boys in Australia.""The number of suicides in Australia is far too high; six men and two women a day for 25 million people or thereabouts, I think it's unacceptable,"" he said.""I'm trying to do what I can to create that awareness around it and that's what the campaign is about.""If you or someone you know needs support, visit https://www.beyondblue.org.au/",https://www.cricket.com.au/news/steve-smith-breaks-silence-scg-press-conference-ball-tampering-mental-health-suicide-awareness/2018-12-21?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,

Jinnah resided in the bungalow lived there in the late 1930s.In the last few years, Pakistan has demanded that the property should be transferred to it for housing its Mumbai consulate.  Foreign Office spokesperson Mohammad Faisal told reporters, ""We have a claim over it (Jinnah House) and we do not accept that anyone tries to take custody of it.

The 28-year-old, who had made his India debut in 2016, was part of the Delhi franchise since 2015, playing in just 10 IPL matches. The IPL trading window remains open until 30 days prior to the start of the 2019 season.",Times Now,"Days after the conclusion of the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2019 auction, Indian all-rounder Jayant Yadav has been traded from Delhi Capitals to Mumbai Indians. The Haryana all-rounder was a part of the Delhi squad last season but didn't feature in any game. The trade was confirmed on IPL's official website. Delhi Capitals and Mumbai Indians both strengthened their squad significantly in the Indian Premier League 2019 auction by roping several star players in their respective squads. While the IPL player auction was conducted on Tuesday, the trading window is still open which gives the franchises a chance to trade players among them until 5 PM (IST) 30 days prior to the start of the IPL 2019 season. Jayant is utility Indian player, who can be handy with both the bat and the ball. Mumbai, who bought Lasith Malinga, Yuvraj Singh, Pankaj Jaiswal, Rasikh Dar, Anmolpreet Singh and Barinder Sran in the auction, already have two good Indian all-rounders in Hardik Pandya and Krunal Pandya but Jayant can be a great back up option for the Rohit Sharma-led side. He has played ten games in the Indian Premier League and scored six runs while also picking up 4 wickets. He has also played 4 Test matches for India and scored 228 runs including a hundred and a half-century. He also has 11 wickets in the longest format of the game for India. He has also played a solitary ODI scoring a single run and picking up one wicket against New Zealand.  Earlier this year, Mumbai Indians had traded Quinton de Kock from Royal Challengers Bangalore ahead of the IPL auction. Jayant is the second player to have been traded to Mumbai this season. Mumbai looks a much more balanced team now with Yuvraj and Jayant strengthening the middle order. Malinga is back to spearhead the pace attack alongside Sran, Mitchell McClenaghan and Jasprit Bumrah. The spin pack will be lead by Krunal Pandya, who will be assisted by the young Mayank Markande and Rahul Chahar. Mumbai Indians Full squad: Rohit Sharma (C), Hardik Pandya, Jasprit Bumrah, Krunal Pandya, Ishan Kishan, Suryakumar Yadav, Mayank Markande, Rahul Chahar, Anukul Roy, Siddhesh Lad, Aditya Tare, Evin Lewis, Kieron Pollard, Ben Cutting, Quinton de Kock, Mitchell McClenaghan, Adam Milne, Jason Behrendorff, Pankaj Jaiswal, Rasikh Dar, Yuvraj Singh, Lasith Malinga, Anmolpreet Singh, Barinder Sran, Jayant Yadav",https://www.timesnownews.com/sports/cricket/article/indian-premier-league-all-rounder-jayant-yadav-traded-from-delhi-capitals-to-mumbai-indians-ahead-of-ipl-2019/334390?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,

The data reportedly included users' dating profiles and healthcare information and was collected via Facebooks Software Development Kit that lets users log in to third-party apps with Facebook. The report said data could also be collected from users without Facebook accounts.",Engadget,"A new report from German company Mobilsicher, an outlet dedicated to info on mobile security, has detailed some information about how certain apps share user information with Facebook, BuzzFeed News reports. The group tested the Android version of a number of apps -- including Tinder, Grindr, OKCupid, health-related apps like Pregnancy+ and MigraineBuddy as well as religion-focused apps such as Bible+ and Muslim Pro, among others -- and it found that personal information was being collected from those apps via Facebook's SDK. That information could include IP addresses, the app in use, the type of device and users' unique Advertising IDs, info that's transferred as soon as a user opens the app.Facebook's SDK allows developers to access Facebook Analytics and let their users log in with their Facebook credentials, and Facebook says in its policies that it can collect information through third-party apps that use its SDKs and APIs. Mobilsicher says at least some developers were under the impression that the information Facebook was collecting was anonymized, but even though users' names aren't attached to the data, the use of their Advertising IDs largely renders that a moot point. Mobilsicher says that as long as you've logged into Facebook on your mobile device at least once -- whether that be via a browser or through the Facebook app -- Facebook can link your Advertising ID to your profile.The findings follow a recent New York Times report that detailed how extensively Facebook shared user data with companies like Apple, Netflix and Spotify, and it's sure to add to the privacy concerns that Facebook has repeatedly stoked over the past year. Facebook's many 2018 privacy infractions include the Cambridge Analytica scandal, a security bug that affected millions of users and a Photo API bug that gave third-party apps access to Facebook users' unposted photos. While maybe not as egregious as some of Facebook's other issues, Mobilsicher's findings highlight, yet again, just how little control users have over their information and what Facebook does with it.",https://www.engadget.com/2018/12/19/facebook-collects-user-data-tinder-okcupid/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,

This comes after Marlboro owner Altria invested $12.8 billion for a 35% stake in Juul, valuing the firm at $38 billion. Bowen and Monsees own stakes of $1.36 billion each in Juul, now more valuable than Elon Musk's SpaceX.",Bloomberg Quint,"(Bloomberg) -- Juul Labs Inc. and Altria Group Inc. just did a deal that transforms them both: The e-cigarette maker is now one of Silicon Valley’s most valuable privately held companies, and the tobacco giant is relevant again for cigarette-averse Americans.The $12.8 billion deal, which gives Altria a 35 percent stake, values San Francisco-based Juul at $38 billion and will put its products next to Marlboro cigarettes on American retail shelves. Altria, which is focused on the U.S. market after spinning off Philip Morris International Inc. in 2008, will get one-third of the seats on Juul’s board upon antitrust clearance. It doesn’t get a controlling stake, leaving Juul operationally independent.With smoking in decline, the deal furthers Altria’s push away from cigarettes and into higher-growth businesses. It comes on the heels of its investment in Canadian cannabis company Cronos Group Inc. earlier this month. Altria also has a deal to market Philip Morris’s “heat not burn” device IQOS, already sold internationally, if it wins U.S. regulatory approval.Altria’s shares fell as much as 3.6 percent in New York on Thursday to $49.57 as of 10:19 a.m., the lowest intraday level since August 2015. S&P downgraded the company’s credit rating to BBB following the Juul and Cronos deals, noting it doesn’t see “significant near-term investment returns” for Altria. Moody’s reaffirmed its rating but changed its outlook on Altria to negative.For Juul, the tie-up more than doubles its valuation from just a few months ago, when it was worth $16 billion after Tiger Global Management led a $1.2 billion investment. The Altria deal makes Juul more valuable than other closely held companies Airbnb Inc. or Elon Musk’s SpaceX, though still less than Uber Technologies Inc.On a Thursday conference call, Altria Chief Executive Officer Howard Willard described the deal as having “long-term benefits for adult smokers and our shareholders.”He also addressed questions of whether Altria had overpaid. Altria had been watching Juul’s growth for awhile, finding it continually exceeded expectations, and sees international growth as a main rationale for the deal. The deal is expected to become “highly cash generative” after one or two years of investing in Juul’s growth, executives said.Analysts and antismoking groups both said the deal made for a powerful combination -- for better or for worse.It “presents a compelling and potentially highly synergistic opportunity” with Altria’s stake in cannabis producer Cronos, said Wells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog, who said she sees the Juul deal becoming accretive in late 2020, depending on the timing of anti-trust approval. Herzog has an outperform recommendation on the shares.The Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids called the union a “truly alarming development for public health and brings together the two companies that have been the most successful in marketing their highly addictive products to kids.”Since launching in 2015, Juul has been a runaway success, attracting the ire of parents and regulators who say the company’s devices hook teenagers. The startup has positioned itself as a technology company on a mission to help addicted smokers quit tar-burning cigarettes.Altria, however, says the deal unites both companies in moving adult cigarette smokers into products that carry less health risk. Philip Morris is already marketing IQOS as reduced-risk in some countries, and Altria says it sees IQOS as a complementary product that won’t compete with Juul. Executives on the call acknowledged that if concerns about youth smoking aren’t resolved, it could put the entire vaping business at risk, even for adult smokers. As such, it’s increasing its advocacy to raise the minimum purchase age for all tobacco products to 21, executives said.As part of the agreement, Marlboro will put promotional material for Juul’s products in its cigarette cartons, according to a statement Thursday. Altria, which sells its cigarettes only in the U.S., benefits from international exposure as Juul expands to new markets outside the country.Altria also announced cost cuts of about $500 million to $600 million a year by the end of 2019. This includes culling “third-party spending across the business,” as well as workforce reductions, the company said.The deal is making Juul founders Adam Bowen and James Monsees the first e-cigarette billionaires.Altria will be subject to a so-called standstill agreement under which it may not increase its stake beyond 35 percent. The cigarette maker also agreed not to sell the shares for six years, during which Juul will be Altria’s only e-vapor business.Altria executives said on the call that the deal has provisions that would prevent competitors from buying a large stake, but that nothing bars Juul from partnering with other companies internationally. Executives said they have no knowledge of how the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which has expressed concerns about youth smokers and flavors, views the deal.©2018 Bloomberg L.P.",https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/altria-invests-12-8-billion-in-e-cigarette-maker-juul-labs?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,

37387,US doesn't want to be 'policeman of the Middle East': Trump,"The US doesn't want to be the ""policeman of the Middle East"", US President Donald Trump said on Thursday following his decision to withdraw all American troops from Syria. The US gets nothing ""but (spends) precious lives and trillions of dollars protecting others who, in almost all cases, do not appreciate"" what it does, Trump tweeted.",Reuters,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday defended his surprise decision to declare victory over Islamic State militants in Syria and completely withdraw U.S. troops from the country, amid criticism from some Republicans and concern from allies and some U.S. military commanders. In early morning tweets, Trump said he was fulfilling a promise from his 2016 presidential campaign to leave Syria. Echoing a central plank of his foreign policy - that he seeks to stop the United States being taken advantage of - he said the United States was doing the work of other countries, including Russia and Iran, with little in return. “Does the USA want to be the Policeman of the Middle East, getting NOTHING but spending precious lives and trillions of dollars protecting others who, in almost all cases, do not appreciate what we are doing? Do we want to be there forever? Time for others to finally fight,” he tweeted. The United States is also ending its air campaign against the militants in Syria, U.S. officials told Reuters on Thursday.     Trump had pledged to withdraw from Syria if elected, but the abrupt announcement on Wednesday to withdraw the roughly 2,000 U.S. troops from Syria caught U.S. lawmakers and others by surprise. The White House declined to offer a timeline for the departure.     Some of Trump’s fellow Republicans strongly criticized the move, saying they were not briefed ahead of time and that the move strengthened the hand of Russia and Iran, which both support Syrian President Bashar al Assad. U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, have told Reuters that U.S. commanders on the ground are also concerned about the impact of a quick withdrawal and were surprised by the decision.   Trump’s move also drew criticism from some U.S. allies, including Britain and France, which said Islamic State militants had not been defeated and that its troops would remain in Syria. The void left by the U.S. withdrawal could undermine diplomatic efforts to end Syria’s eight-year civil war and undercut the United States’ leverage in the region as well as leave it few options if Islamic State surges again.  “ISIS hits us they are doomed!” Trump tweeted, using an acronym for Islamic State.  Islamic State, which declared its so-called caliphate in 2014 after seizing large areas of Syria and Iraq, was down to its last 1 percent of the territory it once held in Syria and has no territory in Iraq, a senior U.S. official last week. But U.S. officials have warned that retaking territory is not the same as defeating the militants. In a campaign to defeat the group in Syria, former President Barack Obama ordered air strikes from September 2014 and then troops into the country the following year. Some U.S. lawmakers, including some Democrats, backed Wednesday’s announced withdrawal but said Congress needed to play a larger role in overseeing such military operations.  Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday welcomed Trump’s decision and said he largely agreed that Islamic State had been defeated.  Trump, however, said Russia - as well as Iran and Syria - were unhappy about the U.S. withdrawal “because now they will have to fight ISIS and others, who they hate, without us.” Democratic U.S. Senator Chris Murphy said Trump’s statements appeared in conflict: “Wait a minute... I thought we defeated ISIS. Why would Russia, Iran and Syria have to fight them if they’re defeated?” he tweeted in reply to Trump.

The UK-based war monitoring group said the prisoners were among 1,350 civilians and fighters that Islamic State had been holding in territory near the Iraqi border. The jihadists control a shrinking strip of land east of the Syria’s Euphrates River around the town of Hajin, which U.S.-backed forces entered this month. The Syrian Demoratic Forces (SDF), led by the Kurdish YPG militia, has battled Islamic State there for several months with the help of U.S. air power and special forces. SDF commander-in-chief Mazloum Kobani told Reuters last week that at least 5,000 IS fighters remain holed up in the enclave, including many foreigners who appear ready to fight to the death.

37395,TikTok parent ByteDance sues China news site for defamation,"TikTok parent ByteDance has sued a Chinese news site for alleged defamation after it published an article accusing its Indian-language news app Helo of spreading fake news. The billion-dollar company said, ""by claiming that Chinese companies have influence over the Indian election the article constituted ""insult and abuse"". Helo had reportedly posted a story incorrectly quoting a Congress leader.",TechCrunch,"There’s worrying news from China’s online media world as ByteDance, the $75 billion company behind popular video app TikTok, is taking a news site to court for alleged defamation after it published a story about ByteDance’s  fake news problem in India.U.S. tech firms have come to rely on media to help uncover issues, but Chinese tech news site Huxiu has become the latest litigation target of ByteDance, which reportedly surpassed Uber’s valuation after raising $3 billion. The company has sued internet giants Tencent and Baidu in the past year for alleged anti-competitive behavior.This time around, ByteDance — which is backed by SoftBank’s  Vision Fund, KKR and General Atlantic  among others — has taken issue with an op-ed published earlier this month that spotlights a fake news problem on its Indian language news app, Helo.Launched in July as part of ByteDance’s push in India, Helo competes with local media startups such as Xiaomi-backed ShareChat and DailyHunt, as well as Facebook. ByteDance operates news app Jinri Toutiao with more than 250 million monthly active users in China, according to data services provider QuestMobile. TikTok, branded as Douyin in China, has a reach well beyond its home front and claims 500 million MAUs worldwide, with an additional 100 million users gleaned from its Musical.ly buyout.On December 4, Huxiu published an opinion piece that condemned Helo and ShareChat  for allowing misinformation to spread. One Helo post, for instance, falsely claimed that a Congress leader had suggested that India should help neighboring rival Pakistan clear its debt rather than invest in the State of Unity, a pricey local infrastructure project.In response, ByteDance filed a lawsuit against Huxiu, saying that the Chinese news site made defamatory statements against it in translating an op-ed by contributor Elliott Zaagman. Tech blog TechNode — TechCrunch’s partner in China — ran an edited English version of the story but it is not part of the suit.Zhang Yiming, founder of ByteDance, poses for a photograph at the company’s headquarters in Beijing, China. Photographer: Giulia Marchi/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesZhang Yiming, founder of ByteDance, poses for a photograph at the company’s headquarters in Beijing, China. Photographer: Giulia Marchi/Bloomberg via Getty Images“Technode edited the piece and removed some of my words. Huxiu was, and is with most of my articles, true to my original words,” Zaagman wrote on his WeChat timeline.To adhere only to “facts” as part of its editorial process, TechNode removed “colorful” parts of Zaagman’s article, according to the blog’s editor-in-chief.What goes missing on TechNode is what incensed ByteDance. Zaagman’s unfiltered statements on Huxiu “constitute an insult and abuse against ByteDance” by “claiming that Chinese companies have influence over the Indian election,” a ByteDance spokesperson told TechCrunch.“The content on Huxiu is obviously a rumor and libel. It’s malicious slander. Whether it’s Chinese or foreign publications, Chinese or foreign authors, they must respect the truth, laws, and principles of journalism,” the spokesperson added.The unedited English version is posted on Zaagman’s personal LinkedIn account here. Here is one paragraph that TechNode removed:Maybe still Zhang is simply a victim of his own success. Few entrepreneurs start a company expecting it to be worth $75 billion. But what he has created may have far broader ramifications. As is demonstrated by Russia’s use of American social networking platforms to interfere in Western elections, misinformation campaigns can be a tool used by adversaries to disrupt a country’s internal politics. At this current moment when China faces greater international tensions, a pushback to their rising influence in Asia, and territorial disputes along their border with India, the last thing that Beijing needs is accusations from an opportunistic Indian politician sounding the alarm about how Beijing-based Chinese companies are spreading misinformation among the impressionable Indian electorate….And this as well:Although, on second thought, maybe it makes perfect sense that Zhang Yiming is peddling products that he himself would likely never use. After all, any good drug dealer knows not to get high on their own supply.In a statement, Huxiu dismissed ByteDance’s accusation for being “wildly untrue” and bringing “major repercussions” for the online publication’s reputation. A spokesperson for Huxiu told TechCrunch that it hasn’t received any summons as the court is still processing the complaint.In a peculiar twist to the incident, Huxiu actually pulled its Chinese version of Zaagman’s piece days leading to the ByteDance suit.

Beijing-based ByteDance hasn’t commented on the fake news problem highlighted in Zaagman’s article, but staff from its Indian regional app previously acknowledged the presence of misinformation.“We work very closely with our local content review and moderation team in harnessing our algorithms to review and take down inappropriate content,” a Helo spokesperson told local newspaper Hindustan Times.[Update: Helo has recently partnered up with local fact-checking webiste Alt News as part of its effort to combat fake news on its app that’s available in 14 vernaculars.]The concerns about Helo are the latest blow for ByteDance, which has marketed itself as an artificial intelligence company delivering what users want to see based on their online interaction in the past. As has been the case with Western platforms, such as Google-owned YouTube,  which also uses an algorithm to feed users videos that they favor, the outcome can mean sensational and sometimes illegal content.Along those lines, ByteDance’s focus on AI at the expense of significant “human-led” editorial oversight has come in for criticism.In July, the Indonesian government banned TikTok because it contained “pornography, inappropriate content and blasphemy.” At home, Chinese media watchdogs have similarly slammed a number of the company’s other content platforms, and regulators in the country went so far as to shutter its humor app for serving “vulgar” content.But ByteDance is hardly the only tech company entangled in China’s increased media scrutiny. Heavyweights, including Tencent, Baidu  and ByteDance’s archrival Kuaishou, have also come under attack at various degrees for hosting content deemed problematic by the authorities over the past year.",https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/19/tiktok-parent-bytedance-sues-chinese-news-site-that-exposed-fake-news-problem/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,

Unfortunately, it sounds like not a lot of people were willing to pay $300 for a security cam, even if it's powered by advanced AI and 3D sensing, because the company is shutting down operations. CEO Alex Teichman announced the closure on its website, where he admitted that Lighthouse didn't make enough money to keep the company going.""I am incredibly proud of the groundbreaking work the Lighthouse team accomplished -- delivering useful and accessible intelligence for our homes via advanced AI and 3D sensing,"" he wrote. ""Unfortunately, we did not achieve the commercial success we were looking for and will be shutting down operations in the near future.""Lighthouse's AI and 3D sensors give its cameras the power to distinguish between pets and people, as well as to recognize faces. If it sees someone inside your home that it doesn't recognize, for instance, it can send you a notification. It also recognizes simple sentences, so you can ask it if the pet walker arrived that day, among other things. The company was supposed to start shipping the device in September 2017, but it didn't become available until February 2018.

Police say 15 bottles of pesticides were added to the prasad while it was being prepared.The 52-year old seer and his three accomplices — a woman, her husband and his friend — have been charged with murder, attempt to murder and criminal conspiracy, senior police officer KV Sharath Chandra said.“Mahadeshwara Hill Saluru Math seer Pattada Immadi Mahadeshwara Swamy or Devanna Buddhi connived not only to take over the temple trust but also to defame the existing trust members,” he told reporters in Chamarajanagar.The seer was in control of the temple trust till 2017, but was sidelined later, which infuriated him, the officer said.On orders of the seer, the 35-year old woman allegedly arranged for pesticide and her husband and his friend mixed it in the prasad while it was being prepared, he said.15 died and more than 100 people are still in hospitals after consuming the poisonous prasad on December 14 at Sulvadi at an event to celebrate the groundbreaking ceremony for construction of the tower of the Kichchugutti Maramma Devi temple.He said the temple was under the total control of the seer till April 2017 generating huge money for him. However, at the insistence of local villagers and devotees, a trust was formed for expansion of the temple.“The seer was upset with the formation of the trust without his wish as his source of income almost dried up. Since then, shadow boxing between the temple management and the seer began,” he said.In October this year, the trust decided to build the ‘gopuram’ (tower) and revealed its plan to the seer, who readily volunteered and got an action plan for Rs. 1.5 crore from a temple architect in Tamil Nadu, he said.The seer allegedly planned to mint money but the trust discarded his plan, saying that it was a sheer wastage of money and prepared another for Rs. 75 lakh and decided to hold the groundbreaking ceremony on December 14, which irked him, the officer said.The seer directed the woman to mix poison in the prasad to defame the temple management and avenge his insult, the officer claimed.On December 14, the two men had poured 15 bottles of pesticide in the prasad after sending away the cooks, he said.The cooks returned and noticed a bad smell.

It will also help resolve the tense situation in the Rukban refugee camps near the Syria-Jordan border, which have reportedly become a regional safe haven for terrorists – and also happen to be located not far from the US base in Al Tanf.""There is hope that this area of Syria will eventually return to normal, peaceful life just like in Aleppo and other Syrian cities before it,"" Zakharova said, adding that ""As long as the US [soldiers] were there, there was no such hope.""CONFIRMED: US has started returning troops home from Syria- White Househttps://t.co/0zNSabgO6BRukban, which hosts some 50,000 refugees from Raqqa and Deir ez-Zor, is located on a territory largely controlled by the US. In August, Moscow warned that hundreds of terrorists from the Islamic State (IS, former ISIS) and the Al Nusra front were hiding among the refugees, holding people hostage and using them as human shields. The same refugee camp was listed in a recent report by the UN Security Council’s Sanctions Monitoring Team as one of the sources of the Islamic State’s reemergence.Moscow and Damascus have repeatedly urged the US to cooperate to deal with the situation in Rukban, with Russia offering to help provide safe transportation of the refugees back to their homes. The Americans, on the other hand, were more of a hindrance than an asset, according to Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu, who earlier this month claimed that US military presence at the Al-Tanf airbase was making it harder to deliver aid to the camp.Moscow urges Pentagon to reconsider its Syria strategy & INF Treaty withdrawalhttps://t.co/IycgvI0jPbpic.twitter.com/RZL1BrBignNow, Zakharova says that Washington has apparently finally realized that it is only doing itself a disservice by impeding the joint efforts of Russia, Turkey and Iran, to resolve the conflict in Syria.Some Russian officials remained skeptical, however, suggesting that the pullout is designed to untie the hands of Washington's militant proxies on the ground. Aleksandr Sherin, the deputy head of the Russian State Duma's Defense Committee, told RIA Novosti that Washington could be aiming for plausible deniability in future provocations by anti-Assad forces.Lawmakers also suggested Washington might be planning to get concessions from Moscow.When President Donald Trump announced the withdrawal, he said that the Islamic State was ""the only reason"" for US presence in Syria, and they have now been defeated. According to Konstantin Kosachev, the head of the Russian Senate's Foreign Affairs Committee, this leaves Washington without a formal enemy to fight, and its only remaining options are to withdraw in earnest or admit that their real fight is against Bashar Assad's government.Even if American forces leave, Kosachev is not optimistic about seeing real change in the power landscape of Syria. He believes Washington will most likely continue pulling the strings through its allies on the ground.While announcing the move on Wednesday, the White House made it clear that this does not ""signal the end of the Global Coalition or its campaign"" but instead marks a ""transition to the next phase of this campaign.""

The new round reportedly values the five-year-old startup at $3.3 billion. New investors including China's Tencent and hedge funds Hillhouse Capital and Wellington Management also participated in the funding round.,TechCrunch,"Naspers,  the South African investment giant, is back at it in India! Days after backing educational startup Byju’s by leading a $540 million investment, it has led a $1 billion investment in food delivery company Swiggy.The new round sees Chinese internet and Naspers ally Tencent join the party, alongside fellow new investors Hillhouse Capital and Wellington Management Company. Existing backers returning to take part in this round include DST Global,  Meituan Dianping and Coatue Management.The deal is the largest investment in a food delivery company outside of China, and it means Swiggy  is one of the few in the billion-dollar-round club. Others include Flipkart, which is now owned by Walmart, fintech startup Paytm, and OYO, which raised $1 billion from SoftBank’s Vision Fund, Southeast Asia’s Grab and others in September.Swiggy was founded in 2014 and it claims to work with 50,000 restaurants in more than 50 cities in India. That’s up from 35,000 restaurants six months ago, and the company claims it has doubled its GMV over that same period, although — like most private companies — it didn’t divulge specific data. Swiggy’s major geographical expansion saw it move into 42 cities in tier-two and tier-three India.The company said in a statement that it plans to use the capital for hiring machine learning and engineering talent, and further its AI technology to improve matching and discovery inside its service.Swiggy’s closest competitors include fellow unicorn Zomato, Ola-owned FoodPanda and Uber Eats, which came to India around 18 months ago.The deal is a real triple down on India and Swiggy from Naspers, which has just seen the valuation of Byju’s soar to some $3.7 billion up from under $1 billion last year; it first backed Swiggy in February before going back for more in June.You’d imagine that the Naspers link is also a major factor behind Tencent’s arrival. The South African firm is (famously) an early investor in Tencent and, despite a well-reported share sale this year, it still maintains around 33 percent ownership in the internet firm — that’s worth around $120 billion as of today’s share price.The deal takes Swiggy to $1.26 billion raised to date. That most recent June-round was $210 million at a $1.3 billion valuation. Swiggy isn’t disclosing a new valuation but Economic Times reports it as $3.3 billion.",https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/20/swiggy-raises-1-billion/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,

37440,TN farmers mimic hanging themselves to object electricity project,"Tamil Nadu farmers mimicked hanging themselves from electricity transmission towers on Wednesday, objecting to an electricity project by Power Grid Corporation of India Limited and Tamil Nadu Transmission Corporation Limited. Farmers of 13 districts are protesting against it, claiming the construction of the towers will ""reduce the value of farming lands"" and affect their livelihood.",The News Minute,"In a desperate attempt to convey their anguish to the government, a few Tamil Nadu farmers mimicked hanging themselves from electricity transmission towers on Wednesday, objecting to an electricity project. Their opposition is directed at the Power Grid Corporation of India Limited for implementing the project and against the government of Tamil Nadu for being silent spectators despite the resistance.More than 4,000 farmers from 13 districts in Tamil Nadu are on a sit-in protest in eight centres across these districts since Monday.The project, carried out by Power Grid Corporation of India Limited and the Tamil Nadu Transmission Corporation Limited, involves erecting towers to facilitate transmission of High Tension electricity. This project was formulated to bring electricity from Raigarh in Chhattisgarh to Pugalur in Tiruppur district in Tamil Nadu and then take it to Thrissur in Kerala. The project was approved in 2014 by the Ministry of Power, Government of India at an estimated cost of Rs 1,500 crore.The farmers in 13 districts in Tamil Nadu, including Tiruppur, Coimbatore, Erode, Namakkal, Karur, Trichy, Salem, Dharmapuri, Krishnagiri, Vellore, Tiruvannamalai, Villupuram and Dindigul, are against the project alleging that the construction of electricity transmission towers will deprive them of their livelihood.Why are the farmers opposing the project?Speaking to TNM, Palanisamy, a farmer who is protesting against the project at the Kallippalayam centre in Tiruppur district, said that the power lines and the tower is detrimental to farmers like him. “The presence of a power transmission tower will reduce the value of farming lands. For example, nobody will give us loans based on our agricultural lands if there are towers on them, we cannot set up a poultry farm or dig borewells with such towers on our lands,” he said. He also stated that if they wanted to sell their land later, nobody would buy land on which transmission towers are erected.The protesting farmers also claim that the police officers who accompany the representatives from the company for measuring land use undue force on the people. They also accuse the police of manhandling women who oppose officials who enter their lands without proper authorisation.“This project is implemented under the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885, which says that if the people who occupy the land that is earmarked for a project oppose the project, then the land owners must give a letter to the district collector, who will then call each owner personally and conduct an inquiry, after which if he deems it fit, he will give entry permission in advance to the officers. Only with that permission can those officers enter the land,” claimed Rajendiran, a farmer who is protesting at Sulthanpettai centre in Coimbatore district.Rajendiran added that despite submitting many petitions, nobody was called for inquiry by the collector either in Tiruppur or Coimbatore. “In fact, one of our farmers had locked his land with fencing. Yesterday, a group of officials visited the farm and the DSP of Sulur broke the lock, facilitating illegal entry. When the women in the house opposed, they dragged them out and locked them in police vehicles. This is atrocious,” he fumed.Farmers claim that though ministers and officials agree that the project will damage their livelihood, they ask the farmers to give in for the sake of development.Palanisamy told TNM that the farmers in these regions have been up in arms against the project ever since work started in 2015. “We have been submitting petition after petition to all officers, from the local leader to ministers. All of them agree that the project will cause irreparable loss to our livelihood, but they are asking us to take the compensation and allow the project to continue for the sake of development,” he said.Palanisamy rued, “The continued neglect makes us wonder if development after destroying our lives is worth it.”Can the project be implemented through alternate methods?Explaining that the farmers were not against development and that they had even suggested alternate methods to implement the project. “We are asking the government and the company to consider laying the transmission lines through underground cables like they have in big cities in Tamil Nadu,” Palanisamy said.Agreeing with Palanisamy, Rajendiran added that transmission lines from Pugalur to Thrissur for the same project have been laid underground. “We are asking the government to change it to underground here also instead of putting up overhead cables,” he said.Rajendiran also added that for land that has already been acquired, an additional amount must be added to the amount already fixed in order to compensate for the drastic reduction in the value of the land once the towers are erected.District Collectors of Tiruppur and Coimbatore and the Sulur DSP were unavailable for comment when TNM tried to contact them.",https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/why-farmers-13-tn-districts-are-opposing-power-transmission-towers-their-lands-93669?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,

Kumar was on Monday convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment in another riots case.,India.com,"New Delhi: Patiala House Court  has adjourned the hearing till January 22 in the second case registered by CBI on the recommendation of Nanavati Commission against former Congress leader Sajjan Kumar. (Also read: ‘Only Option is to Move SC Against HC Conviction,’ Says Sajjan Counsel)In the first case, Kumar was convicted this Monday and given a life term. Amid furore and demands for his expulsion, Kumar himself resigned from the primary membership of the Congress.Thirty-four years after the riots, the Delhi High Court had called it a “crime against humanity” engineered by politicians with assistance from police. Setting aside the acquittal of Kumar, the court convicted him and five others saying that “criminals” had escaped prosecution and punishment for over two decades.The case related to the killing of five Sikhs in Raj Nagar part-I area in Palam Colony in South West Delhi on November 1-2, 1984, during the riots in the national capital and other parts of the country following the assassination of then prime minister Indira Gandhi by her two Sikh bodyguards on October 31.Kumar’s conviction sparked political debate with the BJP demanding that newly appointed Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Kamal Nath also be made to step down. It must be noted that Nath’s name had also figured in the anti-Sikh riots.However, the Congress said Kumar’s conviction should not be politicised and hit back at the BJP, alleging that names of its leaders in high positions had cropped up in 2002 Gujarat riots.The party also defended Nath after he was targeted by the BJP and the Akali Dal, saying there was no case against him, and noted that Kumar did not hold any party post and was not given a ticket for decades.Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh was more vocal on the issue as he hailed the conviction of Kumar, describing it as a case of justice finally delivered to the victims. He claimed it was a vindication of his stand as he had been naming Kumar as well as a few other former Congress leaders based on information he received from victims in refugee camps in Delhi during the riots.",https://www.india.com/news/india/1984-anti-sikh-riots-sajjan-kumars-second-case-to-come-up-for-hearing-today-3488200/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,

It has cost the team because it has lost matches which could've been won if the proper selection had been made,"" Gavaskar said.""They have to look at the combination of their team, look at the hole that needs to be plugged and pick the men accordingly.

The BCCI is a very rich body, it can afford to send even 40 people down there. However, I feel that an India cap, an Indian blazer has to be made a lot more valuable. ... by carrying players and taking 19 players, I do believe that the selection committee has not handled their responsibility well,"" he said.""A lot of those players can come back and play domestic cricket which will not only embellish our domestic cricket, lift the standard of our domestic cricket but also give these guys, unlikely to be picked in the Test matches, an opportunity to regain form and make a case for getting back in the team,"" he added.The first one on the flight back home from Perth should be India opener KL Rahul according to Gavaskar.""He (Rahul) has no chance of playing in the remaining two Tests unless of course there is an injury to any player.

They simulated atmospheres of exoplanets and successfully created organic compounds and oxygen, absent of life. ""Even the co-presence of commonly accepted biosignatures could be a false positive for life,"" researcher Chao He said.",Times Now,"Washington: The presence of oxygen and organic compounds on planets may not necessarily mean that they harbour life, according to a study. In their search for life in solar systems near and far, researchers have often accepted the presence of oxygen in a planet's atmosphere as the surest sign that life may be present there.Researchers at the Johns Hopkins University in the US recommend a reconsideration of that rule of thumb.
Simulating in the lab the atmospheres of planets beyond the solar system, researchers successfully created both organic compounds and oxygen, absent of life.The findings, published in the journal ACS Earth and Space Chemistry, serve as a cautionary tale for researchers who suggest the presence of oxygen and organic compounds on distant worlds is evidence of life there.""Our experiments produced oxygen and organic molecules that could serve as the building blocks of life in the lab, proving that the presence of both doesn't definitively indicate life,"" said Chao He, assistant research scientist at the Johns Hopkins University.""Researchers need to more carefully consider how these molecules are produced,"" said He.Oxygen makes up 20 per cent of Earth's atmosphere and is considered one of the most robust biosignature gases in Earth's atmosphere. The researchers tested nine different gas mixtures, consistent with predictions for super-Earth and mini-Neptune type exoplanet atmospheres.Such exoplanets are the most abundant type of planet in our Milky Way galaxy, researchers said. Each mixture had a specific composition of gases such as carbon dioxide, water, ammonia, and methane, and each was heated at temperatures ranging from about 26 to 371 degrees Celsius.The team exposed the mixture to one of two types of energy, meant to mimic energy that triggers chemical reactions in planetary atmospheres: plasma from an alternating current glow discharge or light from an ultraviolet lamp.Plasma, an energy source stronger than UV light, can simulate electrical activities like lightning and/or energetic particles, and UV light is the main driver of chemical reactions in planetary atmospheres such as those on Earth, Saturn and Pluto.After running the experiments continuously for three days, corresponding to the amount of time gas would be exposed to energy sources in space, the researchers measured and identified resulting gasses with a mass spectrometer, an instrument that sorts chemical substances by their mass to charge ratio.The team found multiple scenarios that produced both oxygen and organic molecules that could build sugars and amino acids -- raw materials for which life could begin -- such as formaldehyde and hydrogen cyanide.""People used to suggest that oxygen and organics being present together indicates life, but we produced them abiotically in multiple simulations.""This suggests that even the co-presence of commonly accepted biosignatures could be a false positive for life,"" He said. ",https://www.timesnownews.com/technology-science/article/planets-with-oxygen-dont-necessarily-have-life-study/332862?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,

It doesn't contain funding for Trump's border 'wall' — it only allows for fencing to be built in a continuation of the current government policy.The vice president reportedly told senators during a luncheon that Trump would sign the measure, if it passes, staving off a shutdown just in time for the billionaire president to jet down to his private club in Palm Beach for his annual Christmastime visit.President Donald Trump vowed he 'will win on the wall' after the White House signaled it was ditching its demand for $5 billion in funding for his signature issueTrump said the new trade deal means Mexico will pay for his wallThe GOP's top vote counter, John Cornyn, told CNN that Mike Pence affirmed that Trump would sign the bill that punts the debate over his border wall to next year.That bill has not cleared the legislative branch yet, however, and the White House did not respond to DailyMail.com's request for comment. Earlier in the week, the White House denied that Trump was mulling a short-term spending bill that doesn't fund his wall, but as a shutdown loomed the presiddent's spokeswoman indicated that Trump would sign whatever the Senate sends him. White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders also said Tuesday that Trump has tasked every Cabinet secretary to look through agency funds to see what if anything they can redirect to the border wall.Trump has claimed he could tap the military or use money that's reaped from his trade accord. There is nothing in the trade agreement that requires Mexico to pay for the wall. The administration is making a more nuanced argument that taxpayers and businesses will be saving money on goods and services that they will inject back into the U.S. economy. Sanders insisted on Tuesday that savings through the trade deal with Mexico and Canada would provide the revenue that would pay for wall. 'The President has been clear that the USMCA deal would provide additional revenue through that deal that would show that Mexico was paying for the wall,' she said.She added: 'He's saying that the revenue provided and the money that would be saved through the USMCA deal, we could pay for the wall four times over. And by doing that new trade deal, we have the opportunity to pay for the wall.'The agreement isn't even legal yet. Although the three leaders of the U.S., Canada and Mexico signed the trade deal, the legislative bodies in each respective country must approve it before its binding. None of them have done so. And there's no direct line of revenue from the agreement to the U.S. Treasury. Tax revenue generated by the trade provisions would not come from Mexico but from U.S. tax payers and corporations.A fact check by the Anneberg Public Policy Center found Trump's claim of indirect payment by Mexico to be false. The center talked to economists to see if the USMCA would provide enough revenue to pay for the wall, using a figure the White House released in January: $25 billion.  'Even if we accept conceptually the argument that government revenue attributable to the revised trade agreement constitutes 'Mexico paying for the wall,' there are no plausible assumptions of USMCA's impact that would see government revenue increase by $25 billion,' Geoffrey Gertz, a fellow in the Global Economy and Development program at the Brookings Institution, told the center. Trump previously has threatened to use the military if Democrats wouldn't fully fund his border wall. As commander-in-chief he can issue orders to the troops. But Congressional Democrats have warned that the Pentagon does not have the power to redirect funding to the border wall. The Constitution requires Congressional approval before money can be allocated and spent, which Democrat argues applies to this move.President Trump has also directed his Cabinet secretaries to look for funds that could be converted to building his border wall, which Democrats have also protested as illegal.Sanders said the White House legal team was examining if such a move could be made. 'That's their entire job is determining whether or something is legal and we are looking to those individuals to find out those specific pots of money that can be used for that,' she said at her briefing Tuesday. White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said the administration's legal team was looking into whether the White House could redirect funds to build the border wallTrump is vowing to fight for his wallIt's estimated it would cost $5 billion to build the president's border wallTrump also vowed on Wednesday he 'will win on the wall' after the White House signaled it was ditching its demand for $5 billion in funding for his signature issue.'One way or the other, we will win on the Wall!,' Trump tweeted on Wednesday morning as the clock ticked toward Friday's partial government shutdown.His protestation comes amid Congress' push for a two-month stop gap solution that would fund the government through February 8, which would keep it open through the holidays. Trump's tweet didn't offer any specifics on what he was looking for in a win and whether he'd want the money appropriated in any stop-gap measure or would be willing to wait and take up the fight again in the new year.The president tweeted twice on the matter Wednesday morning.An earlier tweeted suggested he had more thoughts to come with he wrote: 'In our Country, so much money has been poured down the drain, for so many years, but the Democrats fight us like cats and dogs when it comes to spending on Boarder Security (including a Wall) and the Military. We won on the Military, it is being completely rebuilt. We will win...'But he deleted that tweet and, six minutes later, offered a more succinct tweet: 'In our Country, so much money has been poured down the drain, for so many years, but when it comes to Border Security and the Military, the Democrats fight to the death. We won on the Military, which is being completely rebuilt. One way or the other, we will win on the Wall!'Lawmakers are scheduled to leave town on Friday and Trump is looking to go Mar-a-Lago for the holidays. Hopes were raised on Tuesday a deal would happen before Friday's deadline when the White House signaled it would be willing to accept less than the $5 billion that Trump has been demanding for his wall.'We will work with Congress if they will make sure we get a bill passed that provides not just the funding for the wall, but there's a piece of legislation that's been pushed around that Democrats actually voted 26-5 out of committee that provides roughly $26 billion for border security including $1.6 billion for the wall,' White House press secretary Sarah Sanders told Fox News. 'That's something that we would be able to support as long as we can couple that with other funding resources.'The president on Tuesday sidestepped a question on whether he was still willing to shut down the government to get his $5 billion in funding.'We need border security,' was his response.As for a government shutdown, Trump said: 'We'll see what happens. It's too early to say.'Republicans in the Senate pushed for a compromise that would agree to the $1.6 billion Democrats are willing to fund for the wall while giving Trump some funds to play with - thus giving the president a win in his retreat.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell proposed a bill containing the $1.6 billion for the wall along with a $1 billion so-called 'slush fund' that the president could use on boarder security. Democrats, however, rejected the offer. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnnell (left) and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (right) are working on a temporary measure to fund the governmentSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said his caucus 'would not accept a billion dollar slush fund' for the president. 'Leader Schumer and I have said that we cannot accept the offer they made of a billion-dollar slush fund for the president to implement his very wrong immigration policies, so that won't happen,' noted expected, incoming House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.A short-term funding extension, called a 'continuing resolution,' would let lawmakers avoid the images of a government shutdown at Christmas while punting the solution to Democrats, who take control of the House of Representatives in January. It would prevent the third government shut down this year after temporary closures in January and February during funding fights.  Any deal would have to be signed off on by Trump and lawmakers remain unsure exactly what the president would accept.The White House kicked the can down Pennsylvania Avenue to Congress on Tuesday.'You know, at this point, the Senate has thrown out a lot of ideas. We're disappointed in the fact that they've yet to actually vote on something and pass something,' Sanders said at the White House press briefing. 'So when they do that, we'll make a determination on whether or not we're going to sign that.' McConnell said he was sure the government would remain open.'Yeah I am,' he said when asked about it on Tuesday.  Trump on Tuesday said 'we'll see' what happens in regards to a shutdownFunding for the government runs out Friday at midnightMost areas of the federal government have already been funded through other appropriations bills. Roughly 25 percent of agencies are operating off of a Continuing Resolution that will technically expire early Saturday morning.Roughly 420,000 federal workers, including most law enforcement, would be deemed essential in the course of a shutdown and required to remain on the job. They would receive back pay in the event of a partial government closure, CNN reports.All other workers would be considered non-essential and sent home on an unpaid leave of absence. Congress typically gives them back pay for days missed, costing the government time and money for work that wasn't actually done.It can take weeks for the money to arrive, especially if the shutdown lasts until Democrats take control of the House the first few days in January, putting a financial squeeze on families over the Christmas holiday.  The Departments of Homeland Security, Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, State, Interior, Agriculture, Treasury, Commerce and Justice would be affected. ",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6511959/We-win-wall-Trump-vows-Congress-looks-short-term-spending-bill.html?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,

37501,"Facebook let technology giants access its users' data, chats: Report","Facebook reportedly gave tech giants like Microsoft, Yahoo and Amazon access to user data through partnerships with them that exempted them from privacy restrictions. Microsoft's Bing could see the names of the friends of all Facebook users without consent and music app Spotify could read users' private messages. Amazon could access users contact information and Yahoo could see users feeds.",Engadget,"We regret to inform you that we may have published our article titled ""Facebook's terrible 2018"" just a few hours too early. Tonight the New York Times has once again dug into the social network and assembled -- based on internal documents and interviews with employees, former employees and business partners --an unflattering picture of the data it has been sharing for years with the likes of Bing and Rotten Tomatoes. Taken as a whole, these revelations make the Cambridge Analytica data leak revelations seem almost insignificant.Even with the last few months and years of revelations, the behavior described is surprising -- and not just for users. According to the article, companies like Apple and Russian search giant Yandex claimed to not know how much access Facebook had given them to user information. In the case of Yandex, the NYT said Facebook initially claimed the company wasn't an ""integration partner"" in October just months before telling Congress it actually is, and had access to Facebook's unique user IDs longer than others apps.It claims that Spotify, Netflix and the Royal Bank of Canada had access to read, write and delete private messages as well as see who was on a message thread. Apple had special access to phone numbers and calendar entries that the company said it was not aware of, while also leaving no trace that its devices were pulling in the data. According to a Netflix spokesperson, ""At no time did we access people's private messages on Facebook, or ask for the ability to do so."" Spotify has said it was unaware of this access, and Royal Bank of Canada disputed that it had such access.Microsoft had access to the names of Facebook's users friends and was apparently building profiles of Facebook users on its own servers, while Sony and Amazon could snag email addresses of a user's friends. Even the New York Times itself makes an appearance, with an app that was discontinued in 2011 still retaining access to users' friends list.The reporting confirms other things you may have heard before, like how Facebook pulls together information from outside sources to fill out its ""People you may know"" feature using so-called ""shadow profiles"" for people who don't have accounts.In response to the article, Steve Satterfield said ""Facebook's partners don't get to ignore people's privacy settings, and it's wrong to suggest that they do...Protecting people's information requires stronger teams, better technology, and clearer policies, and that's where we've been focused for most of 2018. Partnerships are one area of focus and, as we've said, we're winding down the integration partnerships that were built to help people access Facebook.""While we prepare for the inevitable apology tour, it seems unlikely that these revelations will go over well in the face of government scrutiny and increasingly-likely regulation. Mark Zuckerberg said in 2011 that the company's FTC settlement covered a period including ""a small number of high profile mistakes."" If those were mistakes, then what do we call the way it's continued to share data widely since then even as the FTC was supposed to be monitoring its compliance?Update (2:50 AM ET 12/19): Facebook has published a blog post responding to the article in more detail. In it the company said ""To be clear: none of these partnerships or features gave companies access to information without people's permission, nor did they violate our 2012 settlement with the FTC...We've shut down nearly all of these partnerships over the past several months, except with Amazon and Apple, which people continue to find useful and which are covered by active contracts; Tobii, an integration that enables people with ALS to access Facebook; and browser notifications for people who use Alibaba, Mozilla and Opera.""Steve Satterfield, Director of Privacy and Public Policy at Facebook:Facebook's partners don't get to ignore people's privacy settings, and it's wrong to suggest that they do. Over the years, we've partnered with other companies so people can use Facebook on devices and platforms that we don't support ourselves. Unlike a game, streaming music service, or other third-party app, which offer experiences that are independent of Facebook, these partners can only offer specific Facebook features and are unable to use information for independent purposes.We know we've got work to do to regain people's trust. Protecting people's information requires stronger teams, better technology, and clearer policies, and that's where we've been focused for most of 2018. Partnerships are one area of focus and, as we've said, we're winding down the integration partnerships that were built to help people access Facebook.",https://www.engadget.com/2018/12/18/facebook-data-partners-apple-netflix-nyt/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,
37503,Indoor sports training startup Zwift raises $120 million,"US-based indoor sports training startup Zwift has raised $120 million in a Series B funding round led by Highland Europe, to aid expansion in esports. Europes True, Causeway Media and Novator Partners also participated in the funding round. In 2018, more than one-third of the Tour de France peloton were Zwifters, Co-founder and CEO of Zwift Eric Min said.",TechCrunch,"Fitness and gaming have been two of the most popular categories of apps for years, and now a startup founded out of London that has combined the two in a unique way has picked up a big round of funding to capitalise on that. Zwift, an interactive platform for people to turn indoor cycling workouts into massive, multi-participant races, social rides, and immersive explorations of new domains, has raised $120 million — money that its co-founder and CEO, Eric Min, said will be used to expand to more training categories (its first steps outside of cycling have been into running), and to add esports tournaments.The funding — led by Highland Europe, with Europe’s True (not to be confused with True Ventures), Causeway Media and Novator participating — comes on the heels of very rapid growth for Zwift .The startup now has over 1 million registered accounts (it doesn’t disclose active users), up from a mere 200,000 two years ago, with users ranging from amateur cycling enthusiasts, people who cycle as part of fitness regimes, and professional athletes who use it to supplement IRL global training schedules.“More than one-third of the peloton in this year’s Tour de France” — despite all its controversies, still the gold standard for road races — “are users of Zwift,” Min told me. There are 200 Facebook groups built around Zwift communities, with people using them to organise rides and sometimes even to meet up in person afterwards at cafes, just as they might in actual outdoor rides. With customers in 100 countries, Min told me that there are on average 300 organised (group) rides a day happening on Zwift.The company isn’t disclosing its valuation, but Min said that the startup is “approaching unicorn status” on account of its growth and big ambitions and it appears to be more than $500 million with “a very small dilution” — a big jump on the $180 million Pitchbook estimated its valuation to be in 2016 (it’s raised around $166 million to date).Min believes that the upswing in e-sports could see the format getting ever-more mainstream acceptance. “Our goal is to bring Zwift to the Olympics,” he told me confidently.Zwift is swiftly addressing two different shortcomings of two common home pastimes. One of the problems with exercising at home — and specifically training in cycling as a first effort — is that it might get a little boring, and one of the problems with playing too many video games is that they contribute to the tendency we have in our modern world to be too sedentary.The service involves you providing your own bike, which you link up with a Zwift trainer (a rack-like piece of equipment that turns a bike into a stationary bike for indoor training), which in turn picks up your stats and adjusts tension and so on based on the course that you are riding. You cycle in front of a TV typically to get the immersive effect, linked up to a Mac, Windows or iOS App (it’s also on Apple TV). You start with a free trial before moving to a monthly fee of $15 (or $10 if you are currently on a trial or already subscribe: the higher fee was introduced last month).There are no plans at the moment for VR headsets or other head-based wearables because so far they have proven to be too bulky to be usable in the physical environment of sometimes-gruelling cycling, Min said. And for now, you also don’t use spinners or other stationary cycling apparatuses because these can’t provide the right kind of ‘real-world’ riding feel, he said. But this might evolve as Zwift partners with more third parties (and with companies like Peloton a big hit with home fitness enthusiasts, you can see how that might evolve).In all of its sports and sport ambitions, Zwift is bringing not just basic tension and gaming dynamics to the table: it’s using some interesting algorithms to help train its users, and figure out what might be the best logical step for them in terms of increasing or decreasing difficulty while measuring all other cycling stats. Min says this all starts with getting an accurate weight for each user.Cycling accounts for 98 percent of the company’s business at the moment, and running is just taking off. For runners, people use running treadmills, and that is the template the company wants to follow, eventually including rowing machines, step machines, and more. Sometimes the locations are actual places like Innsbruck, pictured above. Sometimes they are make-believe terrains, like the fictional Pacific Island Watopia, below:Min tells me he started Zwift out of London because that is where he lives, but much of the development has come out of southern California, since that is where there is a stronghold of gaming developers. Min himself is an expat from America (there are a lot of us here!), New York specifically, who previously had been a VP at JP Morgan and then founded a fintech company called Sakkonet Technology that’s still going strong, and he happens to be a cycling enthusiast going back to childhood.“I wanted to do something different from fintech and the idea for Zwift was staring right at me,” he said. “I was a cyclist since I was a kid, painfully so. The worst thing you could do is ride your bike indoors because it was so boring. I used all the products I could but it wasn’t engaging enough, so we thought, what about taking the tech that out there for gaming, combining that with what you do in cycle training, and bring all that to a digital platform? Even if you could get 80 percent of the experience, that would be better than what was offered in the past.” Highland and the other investors are all strategic, in that they are already investing quite a bit in other fitness enterprises, which could in turn point to partnerships down the road. Highland’s in eGym and Huel; True backs the Ribble cycling brand; and Causeway invests in traditional sports and esports.“Zwift is a fantastically innovative company and they are certainly leading the way in the indoor training space,” says Tony Zappala, Partner of Highland Europe in a statement. “It’s a highly scalable business and we’ve been impressed with how they have already managed to expand globally – already 70 percent of current subscribers are from outside the USA. Research points to an audience of 40 million competitive and enthusiast cyclists, and many of those lie in the traditional cycling nations of Central Europe, so in this market alone there is huge growth potential.”With numbers like that, even without widening the company’s remit, there is a large opportunity to build a specialist fitness/gaming business here, but from what Min says it sounds like this is just phase one of his strategy.Eschewing any comments about acquisitions when I brought up the topic in our conversation (“No acquisitions,” was his answer on that subject), he said that Zwift for now doesn’t have any formal commercial partnerships team in place.Even without that, there are about 50 gyms that are already building programs for their customers around Zwift rides, so you can see how this might develop if it did put more focus on partnerships with gyms, offices, co-working spaces or hotels in the future. “We want to build a business that will last decades, or more,” he said.",https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/19/zwift-which-turns-indoor-cycling-workouts-into-multiplayer-games-raises-120m/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,

The state was under the Governor's rule since June 20, when BJP withdrew its support to PDP leading to the fall of Mehbooba Mufti-led government.",Times Now,"New Delhi/Jammu: The Centre is learnt to have recommended imposition of President's rule in Jammu and Kashmir after the expiry of six-months of Governor's rule on December 19. The decision has been taken after Jammu and Kashmir Governor Satya Pal Malik sent a report to the central government recommending imposition of President's rule in the state, officials said on Monday.The Union cabinet has cleared the proposal to impose President's rule in Jammu and Kashmir from December 19, an official privy to the development said. A communication from the governor's office was sent to the Union Home Ministry which moved the Union cabinet with the proposal for its nod.Now, President Ram Nath Kovind will issue a proclamation declaring that the powers of the Legislature of the state shall be exercisable by or under the authority of Parliament, another official said. The state plunged into a political crisis in June this year after the Mehbooba Mufti-led coalition government was reduced to minority following withdrawal of support by the 25-member BJP in the state.Since the state has a separate Constitution, in such cases, six months of governor's rule is compulsory under Article 92 of the Jammu and Kashmir Constitution, under which all the legislature powers are vested with the governor.The governor has to dissolve the Legislative Assembly after the tenure of six months is over and the state will directly come under the President's rule for following six months during which elections have to be declared in state. In case the elections are not declared, President Rule will be can be extended by another six months.No Presidential proclamation shall in any case remain in force for more than three years except for the intervention of Election Commission of India which has to certify that the continuance in force of the Proclamation is necessary on account of difficulties in holding general elections to the Legislative Assembly.Since the state does not come under President's rule under Article 356 of the Constitution and is promulgated under Section 92 of the state Constitution, all the decisions taken thereof shall have a concurrence of the President under Article 74 (1)(i) under which council of Ministers with the Prime Minister at the head will aid and advise the President.The governor on November 21 dissolved the 87-member state assembly after the PDP, supported by the Congress and their arch rivals National Conference, had staked claim to form the government. Simultaneously, the two-member People's Conference led by Sajjad Lone had also staked claim to form a government with 25 members of the BJP and other 18 unknown members.

The 28-year-old started walking from the field before being called back by his opponents. Strikers' wicketkeeper Alex Carey later said they didn't think it was out after seeing replays.,Cricket Australia,"A sporting decision from the Adelaide Strikers, at the initiative of paceman Ben Laughlin, to withdraw a run-out appeal has helped avert a minor diplomatic incident on the opening night of the KFC BBL.Brisbane Heat captain Chris Lynn was left fuming after new recruit James Pattinson was ruled out by third umpire Greg Davidson in a close run-out referral during the hosts’ first innings on Wednesday evening.The verdict of 'out' on the Gabba big screen left players, punters and commentators alike scratching their heads, with television replays appearing to show Pattinson had marginally made his ground on the tight single.Umpires Simon Fry and Paul Wilson also seemed confused by the call and chaos momentarily reigned as Pattinson remained on the field of play and Lynn raged at fourth official Donovan Koch on the edge of the field.Adam Gilchrist later revealed on Fox Cricket that radio communication between third umpire Davidson and on-field officials dropped out completely after the 'out' decision had flashed up on the big screens.It took a sportsmanlike decision from Adelaide's skipper Colin Ingram to see sense restored, with Laughlin offering the idea to withdraw the appeal.""I'm not sure why it was given out, but I think the common-sense rule needed to come in, and we finally got there in the end,"" Laughlin told cricket.com.au after the Strikers' five-wicket victory.""I think it was our last option to get it done, so we offered to withdraw the appeal and we moved on.""I just went up to Colin (Ingram) our captain and just said, 'Mate, let's forget about this and move on'.""If it had been Chris Lynn and he was 200, I might've re-thought it, but we were in a pretty good position so it was alright.""Ingram said his side had just wanted to continue the game after a delay that lasted about five minutes.""It was a unique scenario,"" Ingram told Fox Cricket at the innings break. ""I ended up chatting with Benny Laughlin and he said, 'what's the option on withdrawing the appeal?'""The initial idea came from him, the good sport he is.""We could all clearly see it wasn't out. You could look like an idiot on TV if it isn't (out) but you've got to back what we saw and our boys were really happy with that.""We just wanted to get on with the game.""Asked if he'd seen an appeal withdrawn before, Ingram said: ""No, that's why I didn't know whether that was an option or not.""All you want to do is get the right decision.""I thought maybe he'd pressed the wrong button or something like that.""Strikers wicketkeeper Alex Carey confirmed immediately after the incident that they'd made the generous call to withdraw, agreeing that the visitors themselves didn't think it was out after seeing replays.""I'm sure you guys probably thought he was safe,"" Carey said on Channel Seven's broadcast.""What we could see on the big screen (was) that James was in, so Colin just told the umpires that we all acknowledged that we thought he was in and was free to bat on.""Everyone could see it, I'm not sure what was seen upstairs.""It made little difference in the overall scheme of the innings.Pattinson added only a further four runs after his reprieve before being stumped by Carey the following over.Brisbane soon slumped to 9-101 before wicketkeeper Jimmy Peirson (24 not out from 13 balls) and No.11 Mujeeb Ur Rahman (27 off 22) revived their innings to help set Adelaide 147 to win.The Strikers went on to claim victory in the final over.",https://www.cricket.com.au/news/james-pattinson-run-out-not-third-umpire-blunder-brisbane-heat-adelaide-strikers-highlights/2018-12-19?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,

""I could find nothing else to wrap her body with,"" said Rajesh, who works as a cook. His wife was admitted to the hospital over a kidney-stone related problem when the fire broke out.",The Quint,"In a tragic incident, a 25-year-old man named Rajesh Yadav, was left with no choice but to cover his dead two-month-old baby with a doormat, after she was found in the charred bed of Mumbai’s Employees State Insurance Corporation (ESIC) Hospital, where a massive fire broke out on Monday, 17 December, killing eight.Rajesh was seen carrying the brand new doormat, outside the morgue at the Dr R N Cooper Hospital, where autopsies of the deceased are being conducted since Tuesday, 18 December, The Indian Express reported.Rajesh had married Rukmini four years ago, and they had been blessed with a baby girl two months ago. Rukmini had delivered the baby in ESIC Hospital, where during the outbreak of the fire, she had been admitted again due to a kidney-stone related problem, the report added.Speaking to the newspaper, Rajesh, who is a cook with Skygourmet Catering Pvt Ltd, said that after Rukmini was admitted to the hospital for kidney stones, he would take the baby girl to her in the hospital ward in the morning, so she could be fed, and pick up the baby and bring her home every evening, on his way back from work.On the day the fire broke out in the hospital, he had reportedly dropped off their baby to Rukmini around 11 am and left for work. Around 6.30 pm, he got a call from a doctor at Cooper Hospital – one of the Hospitals where the fire tragedy victims were being taken for treatment – and informed him that his sister, Dimple, who had gone to visit Rukmani, had been admitted.After rushing there and asking around, he located Rukmini at the Seven Hills Hospital- where she had been taken for treatment after becoming unconscious due to the fumes, the report added.In the midst of running between the two hospitals, he tried to find out if anyone had seen his daughter.Putting together the sequence of events, Rajesh’s uncle, Ram Prasad told the newspaper that when the fire broke out, the baby was in Rukmini’s hands but soon after the two women likely became unconscious on inhaling the fumes, and were taken out of the building by the rescue-teams, while the baby was left behind amidst panic and confusion.It took Rajesh a day to locate his daughter’s body, since miscommunication between the parents and the police led the latter to believe Rajesh was looking for his baby boy. As the couple mourn the death of their two-month-old daughter, Dr Rajesh Sukhadev, medical superintendent at Cooper Hospital confirmed to The Indian Express that both Rukmini and Dimple are now stable and out of danger.(With inputs from The Indian Express)(Hi there!

37517,Video shows 'fish rain' in Andhra Pradesh due to cyclone Phethai,"A video has surfaced online, showing a phenomenon called 'fish rain' in Andhra Pradesh's Amalapuram after cyclone Phethai on Monday. The video shows fish either dead or jumping in the puddles formed after the rains. As per the India Meteorological Department, this happens when strong cyclonic winds sometimes carry displaced fish from water bodies and drop them on land.",The News Minute,"Cyclone Phethai, which made landfall on Monday afternoon, caused havoc for the people along the coastal districts of Andhra Pradesh and officials there. The cyclone, which was accompanied by strong and gusty winds, has resulted in heavy showers across the state and claimed two lives, as it hit the coast near Katrenikona of Kakinada on Monday afternoon.But one occurrence that seemingly amused people was a strange phenomenon, which locals are calling “fish rain”, that happened after the cyclone. A video that has been going viral on social media since Monday evening shows several fishes either dead or thrashing about in the puddles formed after the rains, in what seems to be a residential area.The rare phenomenon reportedly took place in Amalapuram town of East Godavari. Though it’s commonly referred to as fish rain, experts have ruled it out saying that the phenomenon is possibly the result of strong winds that caused the fishes to get tossed out from water bodies and ponds.According to Dr NM Krishna, a Senior Research Fellow at the Central Institute of Fisheries (CIFT) in Visakhapatnam, such incidents occur when rains are accompanied by strong and high speed winds. He added, “Winds and aeration of water in fish habitats and ponds can result in fluctuation of dissolved oxygen (DO). When DO level decreases, fishes will try to move out of ponds and may get displaced by winds.”Dr Krishna further added that the pH (alkalinity of water soluble substances) levels can also show such impact.E Ananda Rao, Assistant Director of Fisheries Amalapuram, speaking to TNM about the reports, said, “We can’t say that it’s fish rain without any scientific merit, we are yet to examine what exactly happened.”According to sources, a resident of Amalapuram captured the video on his phone and circulated it among his friends, which later spread on social media.Watch video ",https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/video-it-raining-fishes-andhra-after-cyclone-phethai-experts-explain-93569?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,

School districts where police responses could be slower, such as rural districts, may benefit in particular, the commission said.It also recommended education authorities hiring military veterans and former police officers who ""can also serve as highly effective educators."" The report pushes for a review of disciplinary guidelines introduced in 2014 under former president Barack Obama, which suggested alternatives to suspension and expulsion to tackle discrimination against black and Latino students.The commission's report said the measure has had ""a strong negative impact on school discipline and safety."" The American Civil Liberties Union condemned that proposition.""The Trump administration is exploiting tragedies to justify rolling back school children's civil rights protections, despite the lack of any evidence linking school discipline reform to school shootings,"" it said in a statement.Over 219,000 US students have been involved in a school shooting since the April 1999 Columbine High School massacre, according to figures collated by the Washington Post. ",https://www.timesnownews.com/international/article/us-president-donald-trump-panel-recommends-guns-in-schools-to-keep-us-students-safe/333311?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,

37521,"India will need 2,300 planes worth $320 billion in 20 yrs: Boeing","India will need 2,300 airplanes worth $320 billion over the next 20 years, US aircraft maker Boeing said on Wednesday. As much as 84% of the planes would be narrow-body and the rest would be wide-body, it added. Boeing also said that airfares in the Indian market are 10-15% lower than breakeven levels for airlines.",Reuters,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Airfares in the fast-growing Indian market are 10 to 15 percent lower than breakeven levels for airlines, a Boeing Co executive said, as the planemaker raised its long-term jet order forecast for the nation to a record despite market challenges. Major Indian carriers Jet Airways, IndiGo and SpiceJet were all in the red in the September quarter as high oil prices, a weak rupee and intense price competition eroded their margins. It is important for the sustainability of the sector that airlines show more discipline in pricing fares, Dinesh Keskar, senior vice president, Asia Pacific and India sales at Boeing Commercial Airplanes, said on Wednesday. “Double-digit growth coupled with losses is what I am concerned about,” he said. “I will forego 2 to 3 percent growth for making money rather than filling up my airplane at rock-bottom prices and never making money.” To date, however, the lack of profitability has not affected deliveries to Boeing clients, which include cash-strapped Jet Airways and budget carrier SpiceJet, Keskar said.  India’s passenger traffic has risen at around 20 percent in recent years, making it one of the world’s fastest-growing aviation markets. Boeing expects the country to become the third-largest commercial aviation market by the early 2020s. Boeing sees Indian carriers ordering a record of up to 2,300 new planes worth $320 billion from global planemakers over the next 20 years to 2037, about 9.5 percent more than its previous prediction of 2,100 jets until 2036 made last year. It said single-aisle planes, such as its 737 MAX, would account for 84 percent of global planemakers’ new jet deliveries to India over the period, higher than the world average. The forecast comes amid signs that pressure on the Indian airline sector, dominated by low-cost carriers, is starting to ease as oil prices fall and the rupee firms. Kotak Institutional Equities last week said in a note to clients that there were signs the worst was over, with data showing flat fares in the third quarter ending Dec. 31, versus a 9-10 percent drop in the previous two quarters. Carriers like Vistara, a joint venture between Singapore Airlines and India’s Tata Sons, IndiGo and budget airline GoAir are also turning to the international market in search of better returns. India has retained a Category 1 rating from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration that means its airlines remain eligible to add new flights to the United States and codeshare with U.S. carriers, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation said on Tuesday evening. Last year, India received a poor rating in an audit by the U.N.’s aviation body, sparking industry concerns that it could be downgraded to Category 2 alongside countries like Bangladesh and Thailand.

37522,"Indian drug regulators visit J&J facilities, take powder samples","Johnson & Johnson (J&J) has said that Indian drug regulators visited some of its facilities and took samples of its talcum powder. This follows a Reuters report that the firm knew for decades that cancer-causing asbestos was sometimes present in its baby powder. J&J also said Indian regulators have in the past confirmed that its products are ""free of asbestos.",Reuters,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Indian drug authorities visited some of Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ.N) facilities on Wednesday and took “tests and samples” of its talcum powder, the company said in a statement.  The visits came as regulators in India launched an investigation into J&J’s Baby Powder following a Reuters report last Friday that the firm knew for decades that cancer-causing asbestos could be found in the product. The company told Reuters in a statement that the facilities were visited by the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO) and some state-based food and drug administrations (FDAs). “Today, a few of our facilities were visited by the CDSCO and local FDA authorities and we are fully co-operating with them by providing tests and samples,” the J&J statement said. “The characterization of these visits as ‘raids’ or ‘seizures’ is incorrect as has been reported in some instances,” it said. “The tests have been conducted in the regular way that the FDA collects samples.” J&J added that the safety of its cosmetic talc was based on a long history of safe use and decades of research and clinical evidence by independent researchers and scientific review boards across the world. It also said Indian FDAs and the CDSCO have in the past confirmed that its products “comply with Indian standards and are free of asbestos”. Quoting an industry source with knowledge of the matter, Reuters reported earlier in the day that drug inspectors had taken samples of Baby Powder from its Baddi factory in the northern Indian state of Himachal Pradesh. A source at the CDSCO said its officials lifted samples for testing from nine Indian cities - Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata, Ahmedabad, Hyderabad, Bengaluru, Indore, Chandigarh and Ghaziabad. J&J did not immediately specify how many manufacturing plants the company has in India.  A CDSCO spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment. Surendranath Sai, a regional drug officer in the southern state of Telangana, on Wednesday said he would instruct inspectors to collect samples there. “On the basis of the news report, we are alerting staff to pick up samples. We will test them in a drug control lab here,” said Sai. “We will take action accordingly. Certainly we are worried because millions of babies may be affected.” Earlier, the Times of India quoted an official source as saying 100 drug inspectors had been assigned to examine different manufacturing facilities, wholesalers and distributors linked to J&J India, starting early on Wednesday. A health ministry spokeswoman declined to comment when contacted by Reuters. However, a senior official at the ministry said the report was worrying. “We are concerned about it and will take action,” the official told Reuters, declining to be identified due to the matter’s sensitivity. The official did not elaborate on what kind of action the ministry could take. A Reuters examination of company memos, internal reports and other confidential documents, as well as deposition and trial testimony, showed that from at least 1971 to the early 2000s, J&J’s raw talc and finished powders sometimes tested positive for small amounts of asbestos.  It also showed that company executives, mine managers, scientists, doctors and lawyers fretted over how to address the problem while failing to disclose it to regulators or the public. The documents also depicted successful efforts to influence U.S. regulators’ plans regarding limiting asbestos in cosmetic talc products and scientific research on talc’s health effects. J&J said on Monday it planned to buy back up to $5 billion of its stock, after $40 billion was wiped from its market value following the Reuters report.

Now, Sonu is in a tight soup and facing major backlash for his recent comments of being better off born in Pakistan. That's right! In an interview with India Today, Sonu made a pretty controversial statement.Sonu had said that he wished he were from Pakistan because then at least, he would get singing offers from India. He also stressed how Indian singers have to pay music companies to do the show whereas Pakistani singers are not forced to do that. Citing examples of good friend Atif Aslam and Rahat Fateh Ali Khan, Sonu stated that they were never asked to pay to sing at shows. Following the obvious backlash, Nigam took to Facebook to clarify his statement.Sonu started off by writing, ""Sometimes in an attempt to make headlines catchy and sensational, some journalists miss the real content.

You obviously don't know him at all.Didn’t know Indian music industry taking share from concerts. 40-50% is bit too much. This is why Indian government should make rules for royalties.Yes, nowadays media just twist everything one say. But I am a bit curious about the payment methods. Why does not Pakistani singers pay to the companies? It can't be because the companies do them favors. They must be paid lesser, or have a different type of contract. Does this rule only work on the Pakistani artist, or is it the same for all other artist out of India?His points are all very logical and right, but media always highlights the Pak part not letting the real discrimination surface which these singers face, Lata has been fighting for it all her life, Mhmd. Rafi also achieved some success in getting rights, but overall its bad for singers.Movies make half or sometimes 90% business on songs, award/wedding/concert shows, etc. earn based on songs, and the singers/composers get nothing out of re-use of their songs and actors take away all money. Singers/composers should've been more wealthy.Same as writers issue in India, they dont get enough till Salim-Javed achieved some success, then Vijayendra Prasad inspired from the duo.And to add to that, discriminating against Indians in favor of Pak artists is worst kind of economic torture.He is absolutely right and mentally retarded journals they pick up only what could fetch TRPI'm sure you must be SONU NIGAM himself ....

Of cinema we are just about accepting female centric movies the audience has a lot of growing up to doWhat are you even talking about? TOH was far from being female centric or even female empowering.

""Capable of travelling safely at over 150mph... it'll feel like teleporting within a city,"" he tweeted.",Reuters,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk made a brief public appearance late on Tuesday to unveil the first tunnel completed by the underground transit venture he launched two years ago as an ambitious remedy to Los Angeles’ infamously heavy traffic. Free rides were part of the grand opening.   In a 30-minute presentation carried by live webcast, Musk touted the newly finished 1.14-mile (1.83 km) tunnel segment as a breakthrough in low-cost, fast-digging technology being pioneered by his nascent tunnelling firm, the Boring Company. Musk has advertised the proof-of-concept tunnel as a first step toward developing a high-speed subterranean network capable of whisking vehicles and pedestrians below the “soul-destroying” street traffic of America’s second-largest city at up to 150 miles per hour. But such a system has a long way to go. The new tunnel was excavated along a path that runs not through Los Angeles but beneath the tiny adjacent municipality of Hawthorne, where Musk’s Boring Company and his SpaceX rocket firm are both headquartered. Musk, best known as head of the Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) electric car manufacturer and energy company, launched his foray into public transit after complaining on Twitter in December 2016 that L.A.’s traffic was “driving me nuts,” promising then to “build a boring machine and just start digging.” In May, the company gave the world a preview of the Hawthorne tunnel, posting a fast-forward video of its interior shot by a camera travelling the length of the cylindrical passageway, which measures about 12 feet (3.7 m) in diameter. On Tuesday, Musk put the total price tag for the finished segment at about $10 million, including the cost of excavation, internal infrastructure, lighting, ventilation, safety systems, communications and a track. By comparison, he said, digging a mile of tunnel by “traditional” engineering methods costs up to $1 billion and takes three to six months to complete. Musk boasted of several cost-cutting innovations, including higher-power boring machines, digging narrower tunnels, speeding up dirt removal, and simultaneous excavation and reinforcement. He also invoked his favourite comparison with a snail, a creature he said moves 14 times faster than the speed of a typical tunnelling machine. “Aspirationally, we should be slightly faster than a snail,” he said. Musk did not say how long it took to burrow his new tunnel, which ended up running short of the 2-mile easement his company originally requested for the project. But he showed pre-recorded video footage of a newly built elevator station designed to carry passengers from street level to the tunnel’s subterranean entryway. The video featured a modified Tesla Model X luxury car on the elevator. When fully operational, the “loop” system as Musk envisions it will consist of passenger- and automobile-carrying platforms called “skates” that can zip through the tunnels by way of electric power once they descend into the underground network. Alternately, he said, passenger cars could be outfitted with retractable side wheels allowing them to travel through the loop autonomously. Musk arrived at Tuesday night’s event in a Tesla vehicle so equipped, emerging from the car at one end of the tunnel - bathed in green and blue interior lights - as he was cheered by a small, enthusiastic crowd gathered for the presentation. Musk created a stir earlier this year by promising free trips through the tunnel once it opened. He made good on that promise at Tuesday night’s launch party, providing one-way trips to dozens of invited guests and members of the media.   If successful, the Hawthorne tunnel is envisioned as eventually connecting to a network of other tunnels, yet to be built. Last month, the Boring Company scrapped plans for a 2.7-mile segment under a West Los Angeles neighbourhood, settling litigation brought by community groups opposed to that project.  But Musk’s company said it was moving ahead with a proposed tunnel across town to connect Dodger Stadium, home of the city’s Major League Baseball team, to an existing subway line. In June, Boring was selected by Chicago to build a 17-mile underground transit system linking that city’s downtown to its main airport. The company also has proposed an East Coast Loop that would run from Washington, D.C., to the Maryland suburbs.

Uber would resume testing with two employees in the front seat, enable an automatic braking system at all times, and more strictly monitor safety of employees. This comes nine months after an Uber self-driving car killed a pedestrian in Arizona and the program was suspended.",Reuters,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] received approval from Pennsylvania to resume self-driving car testing on public roads this week, state records show, nine months after it suspended the programme following a deadly accident in Arizona. A company spokeswoman said on Tuesday Uber has not yet resumed testing. In November, Uber said it was seeking permission from Pennsylvania to resume testing more than seven months after a deadly self-driving crash in Arizona.  Uber said last month that when it resumed testing it would do so with two employees in the front seat, enable an automatic braking system at all times, and more strictly monitor safety employees. Reuters reported earlier this month that after it received approval from Pennsylvania, Uber planned to begin driving “a handful” of cars on a mile loop between two company offices in Pittsburgh, where Uber first debuted its autonomous vehicles in 2016, company spokeswoman Sarah Abboud said. The relaunch is a dramatic downsize from Uber’s previous operation. The company in the past unleashed its fleet in autonomous mode on public roads at high speeds, after dark, in areas crowded with pedestrians and with a single backup driver in the front seat. This time, the cars will not operate at night or in wet weather, and will not exceed speeds of 25 miles per hour, Abboud said. The company has no plans to resume picking up passengers in the robot cars, a service Uber launched in 2016. In March, authorities in Arizona suspended Uber’s ability to test its self-driving cars after one of its cars hit and killed a woman crossing the street at night in the Phoenix suburb of Tempe, Uber’s largest testing hub. Uber also voluntarily halted its entire autonomous car testing programme.

On this day, let us resolve, rededicate ourselves and united to keep our state clean and tidy, and to achieve progress and development in all spheres.”On the eve of Goa Liberation Day, Governor Mridula Sinha also took a moment out to recall this historic day. “Though Goan society had to face communal upheaval in the wake of Portuguese colonial policies, today Goa enjoys peace despite communal diversity… This demonstrates that strong religious identities and communal harmony can co-exist,” Sinha said in her address to the state.For the unversed, Goa was a Portuguese colony for 451 years, until the Indian armed forces liberated the coastal state from colonial yoke on December 19, 1961.Here is Why we Celebrate Goa Liberation Day:The first fight for Goa’s liberation from the Portuguese started on 18 June 1946 by freedom fighter Ram Manohar Lohia but it took 14 long years for the Portuguese to leave Goa. Yes, India got its independence on 15 August 1947 but Goa got on 19 December 1961. Finally, the 450 years of rule of Portuguese came to an end. And every year the nation celebrates Goa liberation day annually and various events are conducted across the state.Portuguese were the first ones to colonize parts of India and were the last to leave. The Portuguese invaded Goa in the year 1510 and subjected Goans to most extreme torture. From 1540, the bloodiest period of the invasion started off. Many Hindu temples were destroyed and prohibitions were levied on Hindu marriage rituals as well. Many converted to Christianity to get an exemption from taxes. Under the dictatorship of Antonio Salazar situation got worst. In his rule, people were denied basic rights as well. During 1946, when India was inching towards independence, Ram Manohar Lohia got involved in the movement to free the state.Operation Vijay began on December 17, 1961, when the then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru ordered the invasion. With a force of almost 30,000, the Indian attack overpowered the ill-prepared Portuguese 3,000 member army. With minimal blood shed, the attack was successful and was carried forward to retrieve the other Portuguese-controlled areas, Daman and Diu. At this point on December 18, the Portuguese Governor General Vassalo da Silva gave up control of the Union Territory of Goa, Daman and Diu. Three days after the attack began, Goa finally became a part of India.The people of Goa celebrate this momentous day with great excitement. A torchlight procession takes off from three different locations, coming together at Azad Maidan where people pay tribute to the martyrs who lost their lives while fighting for the liberation of the state. Post this, the celebrations take off with cultural events all around the state.

An officer said Himmadi Mahadeva Swami, the head of the temple trust, had allegedly hired him to poison the prasad to defame a rival faction of the trust who objected to Swami taking money from the temple's revenue.",The News Minute,"After the tragic deaths of 15 devotees who consumed poisoned prasadam at a temple in Chamarajanagar, the police have finally unraveled the plot involving rivalry and infighting within the trust that owns the temple.Investigators probing the harrowing incident say that a priest has confessed to mixing insecticide in the food, which was distributed as prasadam.On Tuesday, police arrested Doddaiah, a priest from a village close to Sulwadi, after he allegedly confessed to the crime. Doddaiah revealed that Himmadi Mahadeva Swami, the head of the trust, had allegedly hired him to carry out the deed. The Rampura police had previously registered an FIR against seven people in connection with the crime.“The temple was generating a lot of revenue. The trust is headed by Himmadi Mahadeva Swami of the Saaluru Mutt. He and his cronies within the trust planned the whole thing in order to defame their rival faction in the trust,” an investigating officer said.The plotThe Sulwadi Kicchu Maramma Temple is owned by a trust. However, its trustees were divided on various matters, which had led to the formation of two factions: one with Himmadi Mahadeva Swami and his cronies, V Madaiah and the temple manager Madesh; and the other faction with Khajanchi Neelakantha Shivacharya, the assistant manager P Gurumallappa, the secretary Shashibimba, trust members Chinnappi, P Shivanna, H Lokesh and N Keshavamurthy.Himmadi Mahadeva SwamiPolice say that the temple’s finances were steadily increasing and Himmadi Mahadeva Swamy had been allegedly pilfering funds. This angered the trustees of the other faction.“Chinnappi, Neelakantha and the others opposed Himmadi Mahadeva Swami pocketing all the money. They demanded that proper books be maintained. Chinnappi also began auditing the temple’s finances. This did not bode well with himmadi Mahadeva Swami,” an investigating officer said.In the October this year, Himmadi Mahadev, Madaiah and Madesh decided to construct a new gopuram for the temple. Himmadi Mahadeva had allegedly contracted the job at the cost of Rs 1.2 crore to his associates.“When the other members of the trust found out, they were not happy about it. The trust had only Rs 34 lakh left and a Rs 1.2 crore project was too much to handle,” the police added.Chinnappi and the trustees in the other faction allegedly obtained a new contract in December at a much affordable price, and had decided to organise a ceremony to mark the first day of the gopuram’s construction.When Himmadi Mahadeva Swami found that he could not control the members of the other faction, he allegedly decided to retaliate and defame Chinnappi and the others.“The plan was to mix the insecticide in the cooking water. Once the people ate the prasadam and would fall sick, then Chinnappi and the other trustees would be defamed.

Now, a new study reveals the hard statistics on just how toxic the situation is. According to the report by Amnesty International and global AI software company Element AI, female journalists and politicians were abused every 30 seconds on Twitter in 2017.The study is the largest ever examining the way women are targeted with hate speech online. Some 1.1 million abusive tweets were sent to the women, which included members of US Congress, female UK MPs and journalists employed by a variety of political websites. Using volunteers, the researchers sifted through nearly 300,000 tweets mentioning one of 778 women on their list, and noted abusive content relating to gender, race and sexuality.The so-called ""Troll Patrol"" also found that black women were 84 percent more likely to be mentioned in abusive tweets than white women. ""Troll Patrol means we have the data to back up what women have long been telling us -- that Twitter is a place where racism, misogyny and homophobia are allowed to flourish basically unchecked,"" said Milena Marin, Senior Advisor for Tactical Research at Amnesty International.""We found that, although abuse is targeted at women across the political spectrum, women of colour were much more likely to be impacted, and black women are disproportionately targeted. Twitter's failure to crack down on this problem means it is contributing to the silencing of already marginalized voices.""The findings aren't likely to come as a surprise to Twitter -- the company has consistently publicised its alleged efforts in cleaning up the platform, with CEO Jack Dorsey recently appearing before the House Committee on Energy and Commerce to announce his intention to ""increase the health of public conversation."" Twitter is supposedly investing heavily in machine learning that will guard against abusive tweets, but as noted by the Financial Times, the platform remains guarded about the way its algorithms are trained and how abuse reports are handled.",https://www.engadget.com/2018/12/18/women-are-abused-every-30-seconds-on-twitter/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,

The delivery service follows a pilot program started by the companies in Scottsdale in August and involved Nuro’s R1, a custom unmanned vehicle. The R1 uses public roads and has no driver and is used to only transport goods. Kroger’s deal with Nuro underscores the stiff competition in the U.S. grocery delivery market with supermarket chains angling for a bigger share of consumer spending. Peers Walmart Inc (WMT.N) and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) have also invested heavily in their delivery operations by expanding their offerings and shortening delivery times.     Walmart, Ford Motor Co (F.N) and delivery service Postmates Inc said last month they would collaborate to deliver groceries and other goods to Walmart customers and that could someday use autonomous vehicles.

He assured the delegation that the Union Government is supportive of the media and entertainment industry, and would consider the suggestions positively.This is the second such meeting in the year after a delegation met Modi in Delhi in October.He said issues like low screen density in the country need to be taken care of.""We are a very underscreened country. The taxation levels in the country are extremely high (they are in the top bracket when it comes to GST), there is double taxation on the film industry because the local bodies have a right to impose their own tax on the industry. So, if all these impediments to the growth of the film and TV industry can be removed, we see a boom in the quality of content being created and in the reach of that content and in our ability for us to take the India story around the world. The PM was very open and forthcoming. He did say he believed that this was the case. So, we are very hopeful about this,"" Kapur had told IANS on the sidelines of the International Film Festival of India last month.(Hi there!

The capital reportedly comes from existing shareholders as well as new investor Baillie Gifford, a Scottish investment firm. SpaceX last raised $250 million in debt, bringing total funding amount to $2.2 billion.",Reuters,"(Reuters) - Elon Musk’s rocket company SpaceX Corp is set to raise $500 million at a $30.5 billion valuation, the Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday, citing people familiar with the fundraising plan. The company is raising the capital from existing shareholders and new investor Baillie Gifford & Co, who is also the third-largest shareholder in Musk-led electric carmaker Tesla Inc (TSLA.O). The company plans to invest the fund in the company’s satellite internet service, Starlink, WSJ said. The proposed services - essentially a constellation of satellites that will bring high-speed Internet to rural and suburban locations globally - are key to generating the cash that SpaceX needs to fund Musk’s real dream of developing a new rocket capable of flying customers to the moon and eventually trying to colonize Mars. SpaceX declined to comment. SpaceX investors are paying $186 per share for new stock in the latest funding round, WSJ reported, adding that it is up about 10 percent from the $169-per-share paid during an April fundraising. In April, Reuters reported that SpaceX was raising $507 million in a new round of funding, valuing the company at around $26 billion. The Hawthorne, California-based company has outlined plans for a trip to Mars in 2022, to be followed by a manned mission to the red planet by 2024. Separately, SpaceX’s launch of a much-delayed navigation satellite for the U.S. military was halted on Tuesday, postponing for at least a day the space transportation company’s first designated national security mission for the United States.

37617,TN man undergoes surgery after brain tissue found oozing from ear,"Chennai doctors have successfully treated a 54-year-old patient who was suffering from a leak of cerebrospinal fluid from his right ear. Loganathan, who met with a road accident in 2010, complained of intense headaches and pain in his ear. In 2012, he was given ear-drops to ""dissolve"" the mass protruding from his ear until it was diagnosed as brain tissue.",The News Minute,"Since 2012, 54-year-old Loganathan, an accountant from Tamil Nadu’s Namakkal district, has been suffering from intense bouts of headaches accompanied by a sharp pain in the right ear. This would then be followed by a fluid discharge from his right ear. “Sometimes, the cotton ball in my ear would soak up all the fluid and some would even drip onto my shirt. I wondered where all this water came from,” says Loganathan.Loganathan, who met with a road accident in Erode in 2010, escaped with a head injury and a few months after the accident, he underwent surgery for tympanomastoidectomy (surgery to treat infections) in his right ear. This could perhaps have been the reason behind his intermittent ear pain and fluid discharge from the ear, opine doctors.In 2012, when Loganathan reported his condition to his doctors in Erode, he was given ear-drops to “dissolve” the mass in his external ear.In 2017, Loganathan’s ear pain and headaches intensified and this time, he had to deal with a constant, pulsating sound that he kept ringing in his right ear. “The sound would just not stop. It felt like I was living with two hearts - one in my chest and the other in my ear,” he shares.After much deliberation, Loganathan was referred to ENT specialist doctor K Krishnakumar, who works at the Apollo in Chennai, where he underwent another surgery recently. Dr Krishnakumar found that the mass in his ear was actually a part of his brain.Speaking at a press conference, Dr K Krishnakumar said, “I found that the fluid that kept oozing out through a hole in his ear was the cerebrospinal fluid, the pink mass on the external ear was a part of his brain and the pulsating sound was actually the brain’s pulse.”Fungus Cerebri, as this rare phenomenon is called, is an unusual term, given that there is no connection with the clinically defined fungus. This actually refers to the brain herniating into the ear, which occurs when a part of the brain is squeezed across structures in the skull and as a result, high pressure builds up within the skull.Dr Joy Varghese, Neurosurgeon at Apollo, who operated Loganathan shares that the condition could have worsened and caused severe complications if was not treated immediately.“The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) that surrounds the brain matter was the fluid that was dripping through his ear. Also, the pink and insensitive mass that was filling his external auditory canal was actually a portion of the temporal lobe. This could have caused severe infections in the brain if left unchecked. He was highly fortunate that he did not develop any complications,” he shares.After the surgery on November 26, which lasted up to eight hours, Loganathan was closely monitored for post-op complications. Dr Joy clarifies that the mass, which was removed from his ear, would not cause any brain damage to the patient.“In this case, the protrusion was a part of the temporal lobe, which is responsible for memory and emotions. The removal of this would not have affected the patient because it was such a small area and it had scars,” he tells us.Dr Joy also remarks that this could have been the first of its kind surgery in the country. “We checked available records of similar instances but while it is common for such prolapses in the middle lobe, cases of such a mass in the external lobe are extremely rare,” he shares.The doctors also stressed how unwise it would be to introduce an object such as cotton buds or Q tips, usually meant to clean the ear, especially since the ear is an extremely sensitive and tender body part. Its proximity to the brain and the thickness of its walls make it one of the most delicate body parts and any minor accident could pose danger to the brain. ",https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/tn-man-undergoes-rare-surgery-after-part-brain-found-oozing-out-his-ear-93592?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,

Some of them had helped spur growth in rural China by reforming land rights or establishing village committees.It also included those who dared to push the envelope in the early days of reform.For instance, a representative of a group of farmers from Xiaogang village in Anhui province, who banded together to subvert the Maoist-era collective farming system, was among the honourees.Jack Ma, founder of Chinese tech giant Alibaba, is among the world's richest people.But last month he emerged as a member of another club: China's 89-million-strong Communist Party, whose founding principle was the equality of wealth among citizens.The billionaire's Communist bona fides were revealed by the People's Daily, the party's official mouthpiece, in an article praising contributors to China's development.Jack Ma delivers a speech during a computing conference in Hangzhou in SeptemberMa, 54, is not the first nor likely the last Chinese super-rich capitalist to join the party, which counts property titan Xu Jiayin and Wanda Group founder Wang Jianlin among its billionaire members.But Ma's membership had not been widely known until now as China's richest man had previously suggested that he preferred to stay out of politics.Ma, a former English teacher and the founder of e-commerce giant Alibaba, returned to the top spot on this year's Forbes China Rich List with a net worth of $34.6 billion (£27.18 billion). People's Daily said Ma was a party member who has played an important role in pushing China's Belt and Road global trade infrastructure initiative - a pet project of President Xi Jinping.Ma is the founder of e-commerce giant Alibaba and has a net worth of $34.6 billionHe has also been honoured as one of the 'outstanding builders of socialism with Chinese characteristics in Zhejiang Province', where Alibaba is based, the daily said.Joining the party can be helpful to private businessmen and women in the country as they navigate a complicated business environment where the state-led economy dominates many industries and private business can be unwelcome.In China, company chiefs need the backing of the Communist Party to get rich, but they also need it to survive.It is a relationship that - when the political winds change - can hang them out to dry, experts say.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6507033/Alibabas-Ma-NBA-star-Yao-110-honoured-Communist-Party.html?ito=social-twitter_mailonline&utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,

37626,Hackers use Twitter memes to trick users with malware,"Hackers used memes posted on Twitter to deliver hidden malware commands to retrieve user data from infected computers, according to Japanese cybersecurity firm Trend Micro. The hidden commands instruct the malware to perform various operations on the infected machine, such as capturing screenshots and collecting system information. The malware then sends the data to a command and control server.",TechCrunch,"Security researchers said they’ve found a new kind of malware that takes its instructions from code hidden in memes posted to Twitter .The malware itself is relatively underwhelming: like most primitive remote access trojans (RATs), the malware quietly infects a vulnerable computer, takes screenshots and pulls other data from the affected system and sends it back to the malware’s command and control server.What’s interesting is how the malware uses Twitter as an unwilling conduit in communicating with its malicious mothership.Trend Micro said in a blog post that the malware listens for commands from a Twitter account run by the malware operator. The researchers found two tweets that used steganography to hide “/print” commands in the meme images, which told the malware to take a screenshot of an infected computer. The malware then separately obtains the address where its command and control server is located from a Pastebin post, which directs the malware where to send the screenshots — 10/10 points for creativity, that’s for sure.The researchers said that memes uploaded to the Twitter page could have included other commands, like “/processos” to retrieve a list of running apps and processes, “/clip” to steal the contents of a user’s clipboard and “/docs” to retrieve filenames from specific folders.The malware appears to have first appeared in mid-October, according to a hash analysis by VirusTotal, around the time that the Pastebin post was first created.But the researchers admit they don’t have all the answers, and more work needs to be done to fully understand the malware. It’s not clear where the malware came from, how it infects its victims or who’s behind it. It’s also not clear exactly what the malware is for — or its intended use in the future. The researchers also don’t know why the Pastebin post points to a local, non-internet address, suggesting it may be a proof-of-concept for future attacks.Although Twitter didn’t host any malicious content, nor could the tweets result in a malware infection, it’s an interesting (although not unique) way of using the social media site as a clever way of communicating with malware.The logic goes that in using Twitter, the malware would connect to “twitter.com,” which is far less likely to be flagged or blocked by anti-malware software than a dodgy-looking server.After Trend Micro reported the account, Twitter pulled the account offline, suspending it permanently.It’s not the first time malware or botnet operators have used Twitter as a platform for communicating with their networks. Even as far back as 2009, Twitter was used as a way to send commands to a botnet. And, as recently as 2016, Android malware would communicate with a predefined Twitter account to receive commands.Gift Guide: The best security and privacy tech to keep your friends safe",https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/17/malware-commands-code-twitter-hidden-memes/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,

At present, only loss-making national carrier Pakistan International Airlines flies directly from Pakistan to Britain. British Airways, owned by Spanish-registered IAG, will be the first Western airline to restart services to the South Asian nation.",Reuters,"ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - British Airways will resume flights to Pakistan next year after a 10-year absence that followed a major hotel bombing, becoming the first Western airline to restart flights to the South Asian nation. BA halted flights following one of the most high-profile attacks in Pakistan’s history, the 2008 Marriott Hotel bombing in the capital, Islamabad, which took place during a period of devastating Islamist militant violence that swept the country. But security has since improved, with militant attacks sharply down in the mainly Muslim country of 208 million people. In Islamabad, a web of road checkpoints dotted across the city for more than a decade has mostly been dismantled. Richard Crowder, the Deputy British High Commissioner to Pakistan, told reporters in Islamabad BA’s return was in large part due to “an improvement in the security environment in this country”. Pakistani officials hailed BA’s move, saying it will offer confidence to other foreign investors and make the country less isolated. “Once it gets around the world that British Airways has put its stamp of approval on Pakistan, it will put us one or two notches up as a country to do business with,” said Commerce Minister Abdul Razak Dawood.     BA, which is owned by Spanish-registered IAG, is due to begin the London Heathrow-Islamabad service on June 2, with three weekly flights by the airline’s newest long-haul aircraft, the Boeing 787 Dreamliner. At present, only loss-making national carrier Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) flies directly from Pakistan to Britain, but its aging fleet of planes is a frequent source of complaints by passengers. Middle Eastern carriers Qatar Airways, Etihad Airways and Emirates have a strong presence in Pakistan and have been eating into PIA’s dwindling market share. Turkish Airlines also lays on a regular service to Pakistan. Islamabad has been running international advertising campaigns to rejuvenate its tourism sector that was wiped out by Islamist violence that destabilised the country following the 9/11 attacks in the United States in 2001 and the U.S.-led war in Afghanistan. Pakistan was formed at partition at the end of British rule in India in 1947 and more than a million people of Pakistani origin live in Britain. Robert Williams, Head of Sales for Asia Pacific and the Middle East for British Airways, said the carrier believes the route “will be particularly popular with the British Pakistani community who want to visit, or be visited by, their relatives”. Zulfikar Abbas Bukhari, a special assistant to Prime Minister Imran Khan, said “British Airways coming back after a decade shows you where we were and how far we have come”. “Pakistan is becoming less isolated and more connected to the world, and that’s the Pakistan we want to see.” (This story corrects to clarify that BA flights will begin next year on June 2, not June 15, paragraph 7) Editing by Nick Macfie",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-pakistan-airline-britishairways/british-airways-to-resume-pakistan-flights-after-a-decade-idUKKBN1OH0T0?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,

I think my favourite Kohli as captain will lead the team [to a series win],"" Richards added.",CricTracker,"Despite a majestic hundred from the Indian skipper Virat Kohli, India lost control of proceedings in the second Test against Australia. After posting 326 runs, the hosts failed to cope with the masterclass of Kohli who registered his 25th Test match hundred.Sir Vivian Richards, along with many former cricketers, showered praise on the Indian captain for the exquisite strokeplay in tough conditions. The Caribbean legend called him his favorite cricketer and also had no issues with his aggressive intent. He also compared the current Indian side to the team he played against and compared the change in on-field confrontations.Advertisement“Oh! He (Kohli) continues to be my favourite. He is such a little fellow but always punching above his weight. A remarkable cricketer who doesn’t show his cheek, very aggressive. And, he will be capping off wonderful times he has been having if he wins the Test series in Australia,” Richards was quoted as saying by Sportstar.“I remember the days when the poor fellows were timid. But, not anymore. If you engage them verbally too, they will give back to you. This comes when you have a strong captain and the juniors just follow you. But, I love confrontations in the true spirit. That’s why a strong captain like Virat is needed,” he added.Sir Vivian Richards also analyzed the current situation of the Indian side in the ongoing Australian tour. He reckons if the giants from subcontinent fail to win this Test series, they might never manage to do so again. Despite some legendary Indian players like Kapil Dev, Sunil Gavaskar and Saurav Ganguly failing to triumph Down Under, the 66-year-old expects Kohli to do the unthinkable.“This is a great opportunity for India to win the Test series even if they are up against Aussies in the second Test now. If they don’t grab it now, I doubt whether they will ever do it again. Remember Indians had some greats like Kapil Devs, Gavaskars playing in Australia but never won a Test series. So, I think my favourite Kohli as captain will lead the team to realise that big dream,” Richards said.",https://www.crictracker.com/he-continues-to-be-my-favourite-says-sir-vivian-richards-on-virat-kohli/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,
37654,"No settlement talks among Qualcomm, Foxconn in Apple dispute","Apples group of contract manufacturers including Foxconn are not in settlement talks with Qualcomm in the Apple dispute, according to the groups lead attorney. Qualcomm had sued the group last year over alleged non-payment of patent royalties related to Apple products. The group had then countersued Qualcomm for $9 billion over alleged illegal patent royalties.",Reuters,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - The lead attorney for the group of Apple Inc device assemblers seeking at least $9 billion in damages from Qualcomm Inc said on Sunday the contract manufacturers are not in settlement talks with the mobile chip supplier and are “gearing up and heading toward the trial” in April. The conflict is but one aspect of the global legal battle between regulators, Apple and Qualcomm, which supplies modem chips that help phones connect to wireless data networks. Last week, Qualcomm secured a preliminary victory in a patent lawsuit in China that would have banned sales of some Apple iPhones there. Apple later said it believed it was already in compliance but would change its software “to address any possible concern” about its compliance. But Qualcomm was also handed a setback in an antitrust lawsuit brought against it by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission when a judge said it will not be able to mention that Apple ditched Qualcomm chips for competing ones from Intel Corp when the case goes to trial next month. Qualcomm representatives did not immediately return a request for comment on Sunday outside of U.S. business hours. The group of contract manufacturers - which includes Foxconn parent Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, Pegatron Corp, Wistron Corp and Compal Electronics Inc - became embroiled in the dispute between Apple and Qualcomm last year. In the supply chain for electronics, contract manufacturers buy Qualcomm chips and pay royalties when they build phones, and are in turn reimbursed by companies like Apple. Qualcomm sued the group last year, alleging they had stopped paying royalties related to Apple products, and Apple joined their defense. The contract manufacturers have since filed claims of their own against Qualcomm, alleging the San Diego company’s practice of charging money for chips but then also asking for a cut of the adjusted selling price of a mobile phone as a patent royalty payment constitutes an anticompetitive business practice.  They are seeking $9 billion in damages from Qualcomm for royalties they allege were illegal. That figure could triple if the manufacturers succeed on their antitrust claims. Ted Boutrous, a high-profile partner at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP who is representing the contract manufacturers, told Reuters that statements from Qualcomm executives suggesting there were meaningful settlement talks with the contract manufacturers were “false.” “To the extent Qualcomm has indicated there have been licensing discussions with the contract manufacturers, they’ve basically made the same sort of unreasonable demands that got them to where they are right now, which impose significant preconditions to even discuss a new arrangement,” Boutrous said. In July, Qualcomm CEO Steve Mollenkopf told investors on the company’s quarterly earnings call that Qualcomm and Apple itself were in talks to resolve the litigation.  At a hearing in the case in San Diego on Nov. 30, one of Apple’s attorneys disputed that notion, saying there had not been “talks in a number of months. So the parties are at loggerheads and are going ... to have to go into trial.” Reporting by Stephen Nellis in San Francisco; Editing by Chris Reese and Himani Sarkar",https://in.reuters.com/article/us-apple-qualcomm/foxconn-not-in-settlement-talks-with-qualcomm-in-apple-battle-attorney-idINKBN1OG0AW?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,

He further condemned Stalin's ""fascist Modi"" remark in Chennai adding that ""it does not behove well of Stalin"". He said that Stalin used ""absolutely unfortunate"" language.",India.com,"New Delhi: Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Ram Madhav on Tuesday criticized DMK president M K Stalin for proposing Rahul Gandhi’s name for the post of Prime Minister. Addressing the reporters, Madhav said, “There is no vacancy for the prime minister’s post next year. Let all of them (opposition leaders) wait. Good luck to them.”He criticised Stalin’s remarks attacking the “fascist” Modi and his government in his speech in Chennai on Sunday and said “this kind of language is absolutely unfortunate. It does not behove well of Stalin.”At the ceremony for the unveiling of the statue of late DMK stalwart M Karunanidhi in Chennai in the presence of national opposition leaders including Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi, Stalin proposed the candidature of Rahul Gandhi for the post of prime minister as he was suited for building a new India and replacing a “fascist” government.On Sunday, Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) chief MK Stalin had said that Congress president Rahul Gandhi should be the prime ministerial candidate for Lok Sabha elections 2019.  “Rahul has got the ability to defeat fascist Modi government. Let’s strengthen Rahul Gandhi’s hands, let’s save the country,” had said Stalin.The DMK chief had also urged all political parties to join forces and support Gandhi to defeat the Modi-led Bharatiya Janata Party government.Lambasting the central government, Stalin had claimed that the country has gone 15 years back in Modi’s 5 years rule. “In the 5 years of PM Modi’s rule, the country has gone 15 years back. If we give another chance to him, surely the country will go 50 years back. PM Modi is behaving like a king, that’s why we’ve all come together to safeguard democracy and country.” However, other opposition parties had termed this decision as a premature decision.Notably, Stalin’s proposal came at a time when the Congress has been making attempts to stitch a grand alliance (mahagathbandhan) with anti-BJP opposition parties in its bid to dethrone the NDA government at the Centre.A couple of months ago, former Finance Minister and senior Congress leader P Chidambaram had clarified that the grand old party will not project its president Rahul Gandhi or any other leader as the prime ministerial candidate.  Another Congress leader and Thiruvananthapuram MP Shashi Tharoor had also said that Rahul would not be projected as the prime ministerial candidate for the upcoming 2019 Lok Sabha Polls.The saffron party had suffered a major electoral setback in the recently held assembly elections. The Congress emerged victorious in three Hindi belt states—Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, and Rajasthan—which was ruled by the BJP.",https://www.india.com/news/india/there-is-no-vacancy-for-prime-ministers-post-next-year-says-bjp-leader-ram-madhav-3485579/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,

37662,Russia builds new barracks on disputed islands near Japan,"Russia has said that it has built new barracks on a disputed chain of islands near Japan. Russia plans to move troops next week into housing complexes on two of the four islands, known in Japan as the Northern Territories and as the Kuril Islands in Russia. Soviet forces had seized the islands at the end of World War II.",Reuters,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia said on Monday it had built new barracks for troops on a disputed chain of islands near Japan and would build more facilities for armored vehicles, prompting a diplomatic protest from Tokyo. Russia’s Ministry of Defence said it planned to shift troops next week into four housing complexes on two of the four disputed islands, known as the Southern Kurils in Russia and the Northern Territories in Japan. Japan’s defense ministry says 3,500 Russian troops are deployed on the two larger islands as part of a military buildup. The news came after the Kremlin said Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe might visit Russia on Jan. 21 as the two countries step up efforts to defuse the territorial dispute that has  prevented them from signing a World War Two peace treaty. In Tokyo, Foreign Minister Taro Kono told a regular news conference that Japan would lodge a protest.  Japan said in July it had asked Russia to reduce its military activity on the islands, a plea Moscow dismissed as unhelpful megaphone diplomacy at the time. “We plan to lodge a protest,” Kono told reporters, adding that Japan would clearly state its position during negotiations. “The premise of the upcoming negotiations is solving the island issue and concluding a peace treaty,” he said. Soviet forces seized the four islands at the end of World War Two. Russia and Japan both claim sovereignty over them. Despite the tension over the islands, the neighbors are discussing various other issues. At economic talks in Tokyo on Tuesday, the two sides said there was progress in areas such as energy and medicine, Kyodo news agency said.  Diplomats on both sides have spoken of the possibility of reviving a Soviet-era draft agreement that envisaged returning two of the four islands as part of a peace deal.  President Vladimir Putin and Abe have held numerous meetings to try to make progress on the issue.  Japan says it is concerned by what it regards as an unhelpful Russian military build-up on the islands - which has included warplanes, missile defenses and other deployments. Russia says it is perturbed by Japan’s roll-out of the Aegis Ashore U.S. missile system, part of Japan’s defense plans to counter China, North Korea and Russia. Russian politicians say they fear Japan might agree to deploy U.S. missile facilities on the islands if any are returned to Tokyo, and that Moscow could only countenance a deal if it received a guarantee that ruled out such a scenario. In the meantime, Moscow is fortifying the islands. Russia’s Defence Ministry said on Monday it wanted troops and their families to move on Dec. 25 into two new housing sites on the island of Iturup (Etorofu in Japan), and into two other complexes on the island of Kunashir (Kunashiri in Japan). Troops moved into two similar facilities last year and three more barracks are planned for 2019, the ministry said.  “Also on both islands we have modern and heated storage facilities for weapons and armored vehicles,” the ministry said in a statement, adding that more such facilities were planned.

Microphones inside the shelter detect the sound of fireworks and a built-in audio system emits opposing frequencies that reduce the noise significantly. Ford said that this is ""the first in a series of initiatives... that applies automotive know-how to help solve everyday problems"".",TechCrunch,"Dogs have a much wider range of hearing than humans, and noises that don’t bother us can give them a very ruff time. Fireworks are especially tough on many pups, and also hard on owners who have to calm their panicking pets. To potentially help them, Ford has developed a noise-cancelling kennel prototype that it says was inspired by the noise-control technology introduced in its Edge SUV to soften engine and transmission noises.When microphones inside the kennel detect the sound of fireworks, a built-in audio system sends out opposing frequencies that Ford claims significantly reduces or cancels the cacophony. The kennel is also built with high-density cork to further mute outside noises.The noise-cancelling kennel is not currently for sale, but Ford says it “is the first in a series of initiatives—called interventions—that applies automotive know-how to help solve everyday problems.”You might remember, especially if you have a small child, that last year Ford developed a cot called Max Motor Dreams to calm babies who only fall asleep in moving vehicles, a situation many exhausted parents (with high-mileage cars) are familiar with. The cot had small motors underneath that simulated the feel of a moving vehicle, played actual road noise and even had built-in LED lighting to mimic the glow of streetlights.At the time, Ford said the cot might be produced for sale if there was enough interest, but even though it went viral, Max Motor Dreams never did make it to the market. That’s not an encouraging sign for people who want to buy the noise-cancelling kennel, but in the meantime, here are some ways you can prepare your dogs for holiday fireworks.

PM Modi further said, “Those born here and living here are large-hearted and gave everyone a place in it.”Reportedly, Shiv Sena leaders were not in attendance at the launch of Kalyan Metro and Pune Metro ‘bhoomi pujan’ as party leaders and ministers Eknath Shinde and Vijya Shivtare have been invited but not their party chief Uddhav Thackeray.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had boycotted the ‘bhoomi pujan’ for Mumbai Coastal Road recently where Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis wasn’t invited by Shiv Sena.Meanwhile, during PM Modi’s whirlwind tour, two Sena MPs, Shirang Barne from Maval and Shivajirao Adhalrao-Patil from Shirur, too skipped the inauguration of the third Metro line — from Hinjewadi to Shivajinagar — as their names weren’t there on the invitation cards.Baramati MP Supriya Sule, daughter of NCP chief Sharad Pawar, too stayed away from the function. Speaking to a local daily, Barne said, “I have received an invitation card, which carries only the name of BJP MP Anil Shirole, while the names of the other three MPs are missing.”Adhalrao said there was another invite doing the rounds on WhatsApp which had all MPs’ names. “This is not an official card. It’s circulating on WhatsApp. It carries the names of all MPs from Pune and all MLAs,” he had said.Sule’s office said, “Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority (PMRDA) officials hastily printed her name on a blank sheet along with other names and circulated it, making it look like an invitation card.”Maharashtra: Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Pune.

37689,Pakistan organises US-Taliban peace talks,"Pakistan has organised peace talks between the US and Afghan Taliban with an aim to end the Afghan war. Representatives from Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and the UAE are also attending the three-day talks in Abu Dhabi. The Pakistan-facilitated talks come after US President Donald Trump called upon Pakistan PM Imran Khan to help end the war in Afghanistan.",Reuters,"KABUL (Reuters) - Talks between U.S. and Taliban officials aimed at arranging peace negotiations in Afghanistan were set for a second day on Tuesday after discussions around the future of foreign forces and a possible six-month ceasefire, Taliban sources said. The three-day meeting in Abu Dhabi is at least the third time that U.S. special peace envoy Zalmay Khalilzad has met Taliban representatives as diplomatic efforts to end the 17-year war have intensified this year. On Monday, a Taliban delegation met officials from Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates ahead of their meeting with Khalilzad, who was appointed to oversee Washington’s peace effort in September. Taliban officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the U.S. delegation was pressing for a six-month ceasefire as well as an agreement to name Taliban representatives to a future caretaker government. The officials said the Taliban, fighting to drive foreign forces from Afghanistan and bring in their version of strict Islamic law, were resisting a ceasefire as they felt it would damage their cause and help U.S. and Afghan forces. “If these three countries - Saudi Arabia, UAE and Pakistan -  become guarantors and the U.S. appoints the head of a caretaker government in Afghanistan that we nominate, then we can think about a ceasefire,” one senior Taliban official said. There was no immediate comment from the U.S. embassy in Kabul. The latest round of diplomacy comes about a year after the United States sent thousands of extra troops to Afghanistan and stepped up air strikes to record levels, with the aim of pushing the Taliban to accept talks. However, despite U.S. insistence that any peace settlement must be agreed between Afghans, the Taliban have refused to talk directly with officials from the Kabul government, which they consider an illegitimate, foreign-appointed regime. “Talks revolved around withdrawal of occupation forces from Afghanistan, ending the oppression being carried out by the United States and her allies and views were exchanged with the said countries about peace and reconstruction of Afghanistan,” Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said in a statement.    An Afghan government team travelled to Abu Dhabi “to begin proximity dialogue with the Taliban delegation and to prepare for a face-to-face meeting between the two sides”, government spokesman Haroon Chakansuri said in a statement. But there was no sign from the Taliban that they were ready to accept talks with the government. On Monday, Mujahid dismissed reports of a meeting as “propaganda”. The United States says the aim of the talks is to facilitate an Afghan-led process and the inclusion of Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Pakistan in the talks reflects a U.S. desire to bring in countries with an interest in Afghanistan. Previous meetings were held in Qatar, where the Taliban maintains a political office, but a push to include Saudi Arabia, which is hostile to the gas-rich Gulf state, prompted a change of venue to Abu Dhabi.

Kiwi confirmed the incident in a blog post Saturday, working to minimize negative PR, noting that challenges “have impacted less than 0.6% of our robot fleet.” The challenge in this case apparently stemmed from the pint-sized delivery robot’s battery, which wasn’t replaced in time.[Caution: dirty words above.]The battery ignited with “some smoke and minor flames,” causing a student to grab a nearby fire extinguisher before the Berkeley Fire Department arrived to make sure that it wouldn’t reignite. Kiwi says it pulled all robots out of service as it investigated the issue, switching to hand delivery for food.“We learned that the root cause was human error when replacing the batteries, where a defective battery was put in place of a functioning one,” the company writes. “This caused an exceedingly rare occurrence of the battery experiencing thermal runaway.”Kiwi adds that it’s putting a new battery review process in place to help avoid similar incidents in the future.

I have been told that the BCCI wants to 'change up' the auction with a new venue, new timings and I assumed then that they were going to bring in a newer, younger auctioneer. Perhaps an Indian auctioneer, which would be perfectly logical. Therefore I was surprised when my replacement is a British auctioneer, older than me, more grey hairs, heavier! He's a good friend of mine, I've known Hugh for many years. But he's a first-class art auctioneer who has no experience of IPL.

Women shared horrific experiences on social media and were bold enough to name their sexual predators. The movement exposed many high profile names from the entertainment industry. Starting from Alok Nath to casting director Mukesh Chabbra, no one escaped the wave of Me Too. It all started when Tanushree Dutta shared her side of the story and alleged that Nana Patekar harassed her on the sets of Horn Ok Pleasss.  In the wake of Me Too Movement, Producer Kumar Mangat Pathak of Panorama Studios has come up with a new system wherein aspiring actors have to fill up a no-harassment form post their audition. In the form, they will have to state their experience of giving the audition and also any sexual harassment happened during that if at it happens. It’s a positive change and a step to curb the whole concept of asking sexual favours from the aspiring actors.   An actor, who recently auditioned for a film at Mangat’s office, told Mid-Day, ""After the audition was over, the associate handed me a form, where I was required to write my name and photo ID details, along with my feedback on the experience I had during the session. It also has a note to assure the producers that I was safe during the audition, and wasn't mistreated or harassed by anyone.”  This no-harassment form came into being after Vicky Sidana, who used the to handle the production house’s casting process, was accused of sexual harassment by many aspiring actresses. This form will assure that the auditions are carried out in a positive and secure way. The production house has, now,  no connection with Sidana.  Talking about the whole idea, Kumar told the leading tabloid, “Firstly, we ensure that the auditions take place in our office premises. We have installed CCTV cameras in the audition rooms. Post this, we hand the aspiring actor a document to take it in writing that his/her experience wasn't an unpleasant one. If someone raises a red flag, we have a redressal committee [a 10-member team with a legal POSH expert on board] that will address the complaint within a fortnight. It has been two months since we implemented this.”  Well, it’s surely a positive change!  What do you have to say about it? Tell us in the comments below!  What a jokeThis has to be a joke.

In an interview with Hindustan Times, when the Swades actor was asked whether his larger-than-life image of a superstar and his brand image have ever affected his films or acting. Khan answered, ""I truly believe that the image thing is for other people, not me. That perception or image doesn’t mean anything to me. I don’t even know how that got formed. I have no idea as to why hundreds of people stand outside my house [Mannat in Mumbai] every day? What they are seeing is my films, which is enacted by an actor.""SRK said that he is five feet nine inches, does his job and goes home and he can't take any responsiblity for where it has gone beyond. He added, ""I can’t believe in it as that’d be wrong because it would mean that I have started believing in my own myth, and that would be odd.""Shah Rukh Khan is currently busy with the promotions of his upcoming film Zero.

37765,"Twitter warns of state-sponsored hacking from China, Saudi","Micro-blogging platform Twitter on Monday warned of suspicious traffic which it said appeared to be a part of government-backed activity coming from China and Saudi Arabia. The platform revealed it was investigating a security bug that had exposed data, including users phone country codes and details on locked accounts. Twitter shares fell by nearly 7% after the announcement.",Reuters,"(Reuters) - Twitter Inc shares fell almost 7 percent on Monday after the company said it was investigating unusual traffic that might be from state-sponsored hackers and, in what appeared to be an unrelated issue, a security firm said hackers used the platform to try to steal user data. Twitter said in a blog that it discovered suspicious traffic to a customer-support forum while investigating a security bug that exposed data, including users’ phone country codes and details on locked accounts. It said the bug was fixed Nov. 16. Twitter observed a large amount of traffic to the customer support site coming from individual internet IP addresses in China and Saudi Arabia.  “While we cannot confirm intent or attribution for certain, it is possible that some of these IP addresses may have ties to state-sponsored actors,” the blog said.  “We continue to err on the side of full transparency in this area and have updated law enforcement on our findings,” it said. A company spokesman declined to elaborate as Twitter shares posted their biggest drop in more than two months. The Chinese government consistently denies any involvement in hacking or other forms of internet attacks and says that it is dedicated to cracking down on such behavior. Speaking in Beijing on Tuesday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said China’s position on internet security and attacks was consistent. China hopes all sides can deal with this issue via talks and cooperation on the basis of mutual respect, she added.      Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter blamed the decline on concerns that news of a breach could hurt growth and user engagement.  “Clearly, a breach like this impairs user trust in the platform,” he said.  Separately, security software maker Trend Micro Inc said in a blog earlier on Monday that attackers sent out two tweets in October in a bid to steal data from previously infected machines.  The hackers hid instructions in tweeted memes that secretly ordered infected devices to send information, including user names, screen images and other content, Trend Micro said.  The Twitter spokesman declined to comment on the Trend Micro report.

37776,I was told 'Zindagi ban jayegi': Ambani wedding photographer,"Karnataka photographer Vivek Sequeira, who covered Isha Ambani and Anand Piramal's wedding, revealed he was told 'Zindagi ban jayegi' (You'll be set for life) when he was approached for the event in June. Vivek said he only got to know in October that he would be covering Ambani's wedding. ""It took me two days to digest the news,"" added Vivek.",The News Minute,"When 47-year-old Mangalurean photographer Vivek Sequeira was asked to cover a wedding saying ‘Zindagi ban jayegi’ (You’ll be set for life), he had no idea who the client was. Turns out he had been chosen to cover one of the most talked about weddings in probably decades – that of Isha Ambani and Anand Piramal.In a span of 15 days starting December 1, Vivek and his team of photographers claim to have captured over 1.2 lakh photographs, ranging from housewarming, wedding related ceremonies, to an array of entertainment by domestic and international celebrities who graced the fairy-tale gala. For Vivek, this was by far the biggest wedding he had covered and it was no less than a dream.The winner of Better Photography’s ‘Best Wedding Photographer’ in 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2014, Vivek bagged the contract through the acquaintance of a common friend of the Ambanis and the Piramals.Initially Vivek was not even told whose wedding it was. In June 2018, he was asked to block dates between December 1-15, and send samples of his work. Soon after, he was confirmed for the event but the client’s name was kept confidential.It was not until October that Vivek realised that he was going to cover the Ambani-Piramal wedding. An ecstatic Vivek wondered why him, when there were so many celebrity photographers but he felt thrilled that he was selected based on talent.After signing several confidentiality agreements on photos and remuneration awarded, which does not allow him to share any of those details publicly, Vivek quickly raised a squad of his trusted aides to cover the event.A team of 17 from Luxe Captures, the company started by Vivek and his partner Shankar Katwe, left to cover the event. While Vivek, Shankar and four others covered the photography at multiple venues in Mumbai and Udaipur, seven others managed videography and drone with others assisting the team.Apart from Luxe Captures, there was another Indian photography team and celebrity photographers from the UK, Italy and other countries hired to cover the wedding.Note: The Instagram photos embedded in the story are not clicked by Vivek Sequeira.Due to the presence of Z plus security, there was limited access. Shankar and Vivek were given special ID cards as they were official photographers. This allowed them to access different venues as well as be in close proximity to the couple, family and celebrity guests. At one point Vivek found himself standing right between Amitabh Bachchan and Rajinikanth, both stars he idolised, and he could not help but bend and touch their feet.In a span of a fortnight, the ace photographer says that 30 TB of hard disks were filled with photos in no time. Now the team has a one-month deadline to submit the pictures and work on that has begun in full swing.Interestingly, Vivek, who had to drop out of college due to financial difficulties, had started his career as a petrol pump attendant. After a friend suggested that he take up photography, Vivek withdrew the security deposit from the petrol pump manager and bought a camera worth Rs 7,000. But to withdraw the deposit, he had to quit the job. It was a risk, but retrospectively it turned out to be the right move.After starting his studio in 1997 in Mangaluru, Vivek became a popular wedding photographer, especially among the members of the Catholic community. He has even covered weddings abroad. Overall, he has covered over 1,300 weddings and travelled to 15 plus countries.While his brother Vinay manages his first venture Vivek Studio, Vivek decided to start Luxe Captures in June this year and explore the niche luxury weddings market. Starting Luxe Captures proved lucky for him as the Ambani-Piramal wedding was the first contract the firm bagged.About covering the upcoming Akash Ambani - Shloka Mehta wedding, Vivek has not been contacted so far, but would be glad to take it up if given a chance.Story by www.storyinfinity.com (Subs and Scribes Media Ventures LLP).",https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/k-taka-photographer-was-hired-wedding-little-did-he-know-it-was-isha-ambani-s-93526?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,

Ansari’s three-year jail term ended on Saturday, December 15.Foreign Office Spokesperson Mohammad Faisal claimed that Ansari was an “Indian spy who had illegally entered Pakistan.” Ansari, who was “involved in anti-state crimes and forging documents, is being released upon completion of his sentence and is being repatriated to India,” the spokesperson said.Ansari, a 33-year-old Mumbai resident, was lodged in the Peshawar Central Jail after being sentenced by a military court to three years’ imprisonment for possessing a fake Pakistani identity card on December 15, 2015. He was arrested in Pakistan in 2012 for illegally entering the country from Afghanistan, reportedly to meet a girl he had befriended online.His jail term ended on December 15 but he was not able to leave for India as his legal documents were not ready.

37782,Not surprised: Deepika on Ranbir not attending her reception,"Deepika Padukone, while talking about Ranbir Kapoor not attending her and Ranveer Singh's wedding reception, said, ""We spoke before the reception but we have not spoken after. But, that's him. I'm not surprised at all."" ""That's the relationship we share and that's the beauty of that relationship; so much is said without saying much at all,"" added Deepika.",Pinkvilla,"Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh got married at Villa Del Balbianello at Lake Como in Italy on November 14 and 15. The couple got married as per Konkani customs on the 14th and the Anand Karaj ceremony took place on the 15th. The couple announced their wedding dates three weeks before they got married. They hosted a wedding reception in Mumbai on December 1, 2018 and invited all their friends and colleagues from the industry. Ranbir Kapoor and Alia Bhatt gave the wedding reception a miss and sources informed us that the couple was shooting for their film Brahmastra on that day.Deepika Padukone was asked about Ranbir Kapoor not attending their wedding reception and whether she has spoken to him about it on Famously Filmfare. She said, “We’ve not spoken. I mean, we spoke before the reception but we have not spoken after. But, that’s him. I’m not surprised at all. But, that’s the relationship we share and that’s the beauty of that relationship; so much is said without saying much at all.” Deepika and Ranbir are close friends and have collaborated on many projects after their break-up.There were reports in the media that Deepika has got her ‘RK’ tattoo erased ahead of her wedding to Ranveer Singh. However, the tattoo was visible recently but was shades lighter when she attended Isha Ambani’s wedding ceremony with husband Ranveer Singh. Deepika got Ranbir Kapoor’s initials inked on her nape when they were in a relationship.I hope you are not on talking terms with this slut.what you did to kat you will not do with me.RK all ex's have good chemistry with him ! Only one that is hard to believe is Alia, saw a pic of Alia living a clinic on PV, with RK , not getting this link up at all! Deepi comments are always miss understood! Now, kat as well,too!,MK never talked about him! Alia , LOL looks and talk like a despo, not very smart,hope her link up is fake for her sake!,i would certainly be shocked if my wife was to say this to me just a month after a big fat wedding. this is not cool. Even if she said this for PR reasons its very bad taste. She sholud be mindful atleast now. They are not dating now the shit is for real. they are man and wife. you cant be pining over an ex . people usually go great lengths to avoid such sitautions at all cost out of respect and love for the husband or wife. this is just not cool. shows lack of respect and dignity even for the families involved. Whats the need to even mention RK? Never seen RK comment on deepika on any platform.I agree, even if all these crazy comments by her are for PR only, it is still not a good way to stay in the news.
PV please postShe was clearly taking a dig at him saying she didn’t expect any better...but rk’s delusional fans immediately jump on the chance to make it look like everyone is pining over him lol...Pv why are you not posting comments in defence of deepika hmmmm?""But, that’s the relationship we share and that’s the beauty of that relationship; so much is said without saying much at all.” (sic)!
Shouldn't this be your equation with your newly married husband who worships the very ground you walk on and not with your ex who had cheated on you so badly that you went to depression, DP?depression?and why do u make Rs look like a saint? As if he has never cheated just because his ex were dignified enough not to speak and get the sympathy vote.Reason why indian people think deepika still cares ranbir because they are living on romantic Wonderland deepika clearly dont talk with hım and She really dont care if he come ör notHis mining spreading some lies here she told that he and She doesn't talk much they arent even friends next time aşk ranbir to not invite deepika She doenst care even her next girlfriend and comes to his houseHow in the world deepika bash ranbir in this article she clearly said they are far away and dont talk eachother do you guys remember the part ranbir throw he invite deepika not other way around and He is weird för not coming why he talk about deepika babies with ranveer but not coming för ger weedingSRK rightfully termed her as pandora box(box full of troubles) recently. Unnecessary explanation given by her..People should watch the episode before jumping to conclusion.. kuch bhi to bash DPthis is what happens when you move to mumbai at the tender age of 17 and 18, in search of glamour and fame....your brain is not used to thinking and processing. Plz send your children to school and college . Let them pursue their dreams after their they are 22 or 23....thankfully this trend of teens gettign into movies as teens is slowly going after sara ali and even suhana and aryan being star kids are also completing education first...study anything but PLEASE go to college till 22 atleast....Just one question- by chance if RK asks her to marry him, what would her reaction be???same as in LAK.....Katrina n dignity is opposite of each other.can plz samebody read her GQ interview n recent outgoing promotion how indirectly she speaking how lonely n all she became after breakup n all that.Katrina is not dignity personified... Perhaps the only actress who comes across as dignified is Vidya Balan. But Katrina is miles dignified that Deepika any day. Deepika made a national pandemonium of her breakup with Ranbir and how he cheated on her. Katrina maintained a very dignified stand when the same happened to her.
Katrina becomes undignified for admitting to becoming lonely after the breakup but Deepika is still so dignified for talking about her cheating ex's boxers and boasting the beauty of non-existent relationship she still has with her cheater ex despite being married to the guy who dotes on her.
BTW bringing Katrina down is not going to elevate Deepika's lack of class and dignity that the world has been witnessing since her breakup with Ranbir in 2008-a decade ago.She always thinks before she talks except when she talks about this guy! She is surely smart enough to know that the media will drag anything she says about him endlessly....unless she does all this knowingly!Pinkvilla kindly post my comment :Reason why I starting disliking deepika was when she came on Koffee and ripped Ranbir apart. After that his reputation , image went down n was famously named casanova(yes he is one for sure though) and was butt of all jokes. But then that should have been it,done ,dusted move on. If you really love someone , then don't badmouth them, accept them the way they are n let go. But then Weirdest thing is after defaming him , she flipped and started saying great things about their relationship. Rest is history , every now n then she displays how beyond divine their relationship is bla bla. Either she shouldn't have badmouthed him or later shouldn't have flipped. Also i have never seen Deepika talking dearly about Ranveer as she does for RK , feel so bad for him.I get it , she loves Ranbir ,we all can clearly see. That's how love is , its heart and you have no control. If so ,keep it with you and try to be fair. Look at Rekha , she proved her love for AB and we all know how mean he was to all women in his life. But I respect Rekha, she never defamed him despite of his flaws and never publically acknowledges her love. This is true love.When deepika speaks in general , its her least admirable quality maybe its the lack of proper education.....is she trying to prove a point by saying stuff about Ranbir, woman no one at this point cares about u and ranbir and the media will keep twisting your words, just throw that damn man in the pit and leave him thereHe just gave u a royal snub on Ur wedding day...it's not coz u r special to him...but the exact opposite...can't even bother...girl wake up n smell the coffeeAt least now stop glorifying Ur relationship with they psycho sadistAt least now stop glorifying Ur relationship with they psycho sadistKatrina fell in love and fell out of love with Ranbir, there was never any lingering like this. That's with SALMAN on her end.Deepika...please stop talking...Dp is married .Rk would never even dream of being with her ever agian.He doesn't want used goods.RK can't stand her anyway.What do you mean by used goods? Shame on you for commenting about a woman like this. Pinkvilla needs to learn how to moderate comments.for the first time i feel Neetu was right!!!She is exactly like her character in Love Aaj Kal....hope saif is RK ...she will walk out of marriage as she is crazy over RK still ...and RK will not commit or love any other though he will date many!! plz bring me the popcorn!Can't she respect RS family if not herself?! This is so sad . Both the husband and wife are blind about their own marriage! RS being so chill about his wife feelings for her ex and him thinking marrying Deepika is the best thing in his life! Smell the disaster...Alia should tell her to shut upRanbir should attend priyanka reception to give Dp an idea about the special relationship he shares with her.She is frustrated with her marriage already. Looking at greener pastures in ever available RK. He looks depressed too.If you want DP to stop talking about RK tell the journos to stop asking about it.Jitesh only asked her about her reception...she must have stopped with the first line...Ranbir would attend Priyanka's reception on the 20th.That'll definitely give Deepika a better understanding of the special relationship she shares with Ranbir.Not right. Deepika plz be graceful and move on! You are married .If I was RS I would like to have a TALK about why she made the last statement. I would freak out if my wife said this about her ex. Would cut her of temporarilyShe is only in her thoughts ! Deepika maybe RK is not talking to you becoz he doesn't want to and needs you to shut up about him! No connection as you think. Wat happened to your KWK statement of not living in the headShe will break and shatter the day RKs marriage is announced. RS bro watch out and hope you will be there as a dutiful husband .She definitely obsessed with RK still....it will destroy her tat RK has a woman in his life and bed permanently. The latter where she desperately wanted to be ...tamasha promotions proved it:PDeepika can't take a no....she is like SRK in Darr lolKatrina gains my respect in this regard. She maintains that dignity after her break up.RANKAT never broke up. RK himself said on Rajeen masand show and famouly filmfare during JJ promotionAs usual people will continue to bash the mentally unstable one as an immature woman for speaking her mind and heart out. Whatever it is, Deepika has been driven to depression and she has every right to be angry or sad about it. Likewise, Ranbir is involved in it and he has every right to speak up or stay mum on it. We are the ones who don't have the right to speak because we are not the ones who are not going through whatever Deepika and Ranbir are for a long time. We can't expect everyone to heal immediately. Clearly for Deepika it has affected her on so many levels and she has every right to take her time. And of course, it might seem disrespectful to Ranveer but clearly he is her husband who loves her unconditionally and he knows her more than we do. We have no say in this. Ranbir's fans and Deepika's haters really need to stop bashing her just so Ranbir can keep the moral high ground for staying quiet on this. Ranbir staying quiet on this doesn't make him strong nor is Deepika weak for speaking her heart out. Show some empathy.are you blind or deaf, the reason why celebrities talk to to be in news, and they want people talk abt them, otherwise they will not hire PR people to pump them in everywhere possibleExactlyThat’s why I love Ash she stood against salman & shahrukh in her prime time and never looked back . Deepika & kat both do7have any self respect.Omg Mrs Ujjala Padukone please speak to your daughter. This is so inappropriate as a new bride. What would RS and his family think? Dpad its not cute anymore. This isn't heartbreak high, you're married now!Ranbir nahi toh Ranveer hi sahi. Naam se fark padta hai lol.""so much is said without saying much at all"" So all her life they will hardly speak, but will say so many unsaid things ? Damn she could have just stopped short of saying this. This proves infidelity in thoughts even if she waited for six years. She moved on a bit only after Alia came into his life, thinking Ranbir will always have a roving eye and satisfied in her revenge.This is disrespectful not just the her husband but her marriage. She is still immature at 32.They both use each other to be in the news. However, I will never understand why Ranbir chose to be nice to her despite her saying such awful things about him after they broke up. If she spoke against anyone with a bigger name, they would have ended her career. She got away because Ranbir was too nice to do anything about it. He never said anything awful about her and she is no doodh ki dhuli as we all know. I hate Ranbir but I think it was still nice of him to never badmouth her, lolYou must be living in your own make chauvinistic world then!Salman first love is not katrinaWhy is she so obsessed over him? They never looked good together.In movies yes because they were cast in 2 of the best movies which had amazing script.In my opinion Katrina and Rk looked made for each other and Dp looks good with her doormat sorry her huuuusbaand.Rk needs to marry ASAP to stop her talking, I was hoping she would change after getting married but nahhhhh this women just doesn’t stop.My darling Rk no matter how much you hide from social media or no matter how much you try to do your own thing this women will dig you out of your grave and will carry on speaking about you till her last breathe.I feel sorry for you.yes she is such a bad women, poor RK will be struck like ABJrShe should have stopped at 'but we have nor spoken after'.This is her full time job now..Ranveer will do movies and bring money and DP will focus fully on RK to destroy him.Her statement comes after Alia RK watsapp news.i thought she will be done speaking about him atleast after marriage...but its only gettign worse now! totally rekha""so much is said without saying much at all"" WTF this woman even means, respect your husband, anything for newsDoes she have even a little common sense. It is a good thing to be honest and if she will love him forever despite getting married, that is fine too but when speaking in public she needs to be careful, it’s not always about what she feels she should also think about RK, will he like the way she says things about him? and what will his family & girl friend feel?Why will she care for RK or his gf? Lol she wants his relationship with his gf destroyed ...Jeez I don't see anything wrong with what she said...Some people have a dirty mind. And I don't think she still likes him I just think she knows him very well. What's the big deal.I really hoped this RK nonsense would end after marriage but no she's still going to continue with this rubbish. Ranveer isn't going to do anything about it, he's too far gone in love with her. I won't be suprised if she's like this even when she has kids. This women has no shame.Ranveer singh, the doormat...husband goals LOLOh god, he will always be her weakness, first love and the main cause of her depression.He's not her first love.Depression?give it a rest please,why blame him for everything.She claim to have bagged herself a perfect husband according to her fans so why don’t she speak about him and leave Rk the duck alone.Just like salman is always kat weakness , first love and the main cause of kat depression.
post pv u arentOh god, he will always be her weakness, first love and the main cause of her depression.People need to stop making RK look like every girl’s dream! She was only talking casuallyYou call this casually?seriouly nobody is making Rk look like everyone girls dream, nobody has forced all this women to take his name and speak about him all the time.He himself is hiding all he can to give it a rest.She has sucked the life out of Rk the last ten years,I was hoping she would stop after getting married but no, she’ll never stop.Exactly!!! She has mentioned RK in every interview to elicit sympathy and has made a career out of it! Deepika needs to move on and focus on her husband who is so supportive, get a better stylist and simply move on...............rekha !Can she sign some good films. She has not signed any film from past 2 years and keep giving these wtf statements.InappropriateWhen will she stop....i know she was asked a question but she could have answered in more respectful way since she’s married now....she could have been more sensible towards her husband....her answer makes it clear that he’ll always remain special for her....let him be .They need eachother for work...for years deepika made him seems irresistible...but also exposed him...it was the golden era for ranbir with big hits and two top heroines pitted against eachother for his sake...now deepika satteled down...kat moved on...they doing great professionally after they get ride of ranbir negative influence...but ranbir still the same immature guy who using top actresses to stay in news... while his stardom at stake...
Post PV...From Depika's comment one can tell that she understands him and has no negative feelings towards him.So stop trying to make a mountain out of a molehill people.forget wife....i would break up with my gf for this! is RS blind?!...oh yes! he is :PI think she understands it's weird look for a ex-boyfriend to attend his ex-girlfriend's wedding.Also RK only attended one event since coming back to NY and that was the Ambani Sangeet and even then he left the same night.Weird praising that relationship that way. Indian actors so desperate to copy everything people say in the west but do not imitate it the right way or in the right context.Thy do share a very understanding relationship and a cute friendship which is niceNever say never again :-)its called CHEATING ON YOUR HUSBAND relationship lolShe has to stay friends with him, he is currently the best actor and they had two big hits after their break up. In a different working field she would ignore him for sure. This says enough: But, that’s him. I’m not surprised at all.RS dude! are you even reading this?!WTF deepika! you are talking abotu RK like you are still lovers! shame on youshe never spoke with so much love about her own husband! RS should have never maaried her! ewwHi jealous Kat . We know you are jealous of dp getting married to a nice person like rs while you are still single and fail to marry rk. Dp has talk about rs with much more love and her actions too proved it.
Pv kindly postRun Ranveer RunSuggest that you focus on your own little husband madam. We know that you had your eyes on RS so now you hate dp cause she is the winner . Yay !! for DP.Hain ? get over him dp he is getting married to aliaShe was asked a question and she gave a polite response so what is wrong with that ?oh boy. eww.is she mad?!have some self respect womanTell this to katso shes hinting she will forever have a thing for him lolNo she’s hinting he still has a thing for her so couldn’t muster up the courage to show up to congratulate her and her husband. It appears she’s probably right.I agree! thats what she meant! She took a sly dig at him and then over compensated becos she always tries to be politically correct. She is TOTALLY over him, looks damn happy , and she wanted to focus the attention on RK, and how its him who has no chill! Go DP!Hi RK !Hi DpWhat the hell that means. So much is said without saying much at all.Leave them alone people.

37783,'Rangoon' actors didn't gel well with each other: Director,"Vishal Bhardwaj, while talking about his 2017 film 'Rangoon', said, ""The actors...in the film [Saif Ali Khan, Shahid Kapoor, Kangana Ranaut] didn't gel well with each other. It all got quite badly messed up in the end."" ""We as an industry cannot make a film as ambitious in scale as...'Rangoon'...It was out of my hand for that film,"" added Vishal.",Pinkvilla,"In the start of 2017, ace filmmaker Vishal Bhardwaj gave us a movie which had three talented actors of Bollywood playing the lead roles but failed to impress at the box-office. Yes, we are talking about Rangoon which starred Saif Ali Khan, Shahid Kapoor and Kangana Ranaut in the lead roles. People loved the incredible performances delivered by these actors and wished the movie could have done justice to it as well.During an interaction with Huffington Post, Vishal named Rangoon when asked about the movie which was closed to his heart but didn't get a good response. He stated, ""There I was trying to do something else, I was trying to match the aesthetics of a musical with a real world. Then the VFX. It was out of my hand for that film. We as an industry cannot make a film as ambitious in scale as a Rangoon. The actors that were in the film (Saif, Shahid and Kangana) they didn’t gel well with each other. It all got quite badly messed up in the end.""Talking about the actors not gelling well on the sets affecting the final output, Vishal said, ""It must have. I don’t have a perspective on that. I haven’t watched Rangoon since it released. Recently, I was in Chicago where they were playing Haider and this was the rare time when I had an opinion about my work—I felt that Haider was an accomplishment. Then I’d say it’s Maqbool and then Omkara.""Do you agree with Vishal? Let us know in the comments below.Even Vidya , PC, Ranveer, Kangana has nothing positive to say about Shahid. He and Mira and becoming the most disliked husband and wife of bollywoodshahid has acted with vishal in 3 movies, one was commercial success, other was critically acclaimed, only this was a dud. so shahid cant be blamed for this movie or even unfriendliness.Despite all the problems between the actors behind the scenes, they all acted well. In fact the acting was the saving grace of that movie. VB is a great director but he is clueless with respect to the pulse of the audience. He should take the blame for the failure instead of putting it on the actors. I thought Shahid and Kangana had very good chemistry even though they looked like they couldn't stand each other during promotions.Kangana is not the easiest person to get along with so let's not put the entire blame on Shahid.Shahid also played dirty PR with RS , that’s why Ranveer is pissed with him.This is timed with Manikarnika's trailer release. This is harassment. Shahid is no where today after ranveer's and PC's marriage. Nice try to get in the news. Distasteful tactics.TO be fair, even though Shahid and Kangang did not get along, they were phenomenal together and Saif was decent too. The problem was the cliched and half-baked script and uninspired direction. So, Mr. Bharadwaj, you and your writers will have to shoulder the blame for this one, I am afraid.Everyone knows Shahid can’t handle strong women!! He is the male version of Sonam Kapoor in terms of being entitled!!!Shahid comes off very bratish, rude, condescending and I use to like him. Also the way he speaks to Mira, like he knows everything better. He also gives her looks when she says something he doesnt like.Shahid and Kangana were savage af with each other during promotions. I remember being shocked at the outward hostility. He strikes me as an entitled brat and she’s not one to be talked down to. He likes quiet actresses who shut up and do as they’re told.Watch half a minute of shahid-kangana's interviews and it's obvious they hate eachother's guts. the condescension and disdain on shahid's face at everyyyything kangana said, and kangana just ignoring his standoffishness was really something.True. Hats off to her for maintaining decorum and dignity on air. He was really going after her at every chance he got.Shahid was the best part of the movie, he looked great and acting was classic, too bad it got wasted because of KR bad acting. She was horrible in that movie, to date KR did best work in Gangster.I loved the movie. Shahid & K, had great chemistry, it's sad to hear them not geeting along, their interviews were so CRINGE!!You can mean what you want. But it was a horrible movie experience not because of acting which is sad.It was a bad bad movie! I got up to go twice, to to long for no good reason. Acting was fine.Vishal sir Rangoon was a bad movie starting with the story and script, so no need to blame the actors, as a good director you might want to direct movies with real life realistic stories other than Shakespeare inspaied ones, bring stories that the audience want to hearBlaming the actors is very low. He is the film maker, it was his responsibility to create a harmonious set and work out problems between the cast.Vishal makes good interpretations of Shakespeare where u already have the story whereas Rangoon had it's own flaws . Saif & Shahid both had already worked with Vishal in the past but there was the awkwardness of the past behind them .At least Saif is mature enough to hide his personal feelings whereas the other 2 were sniping like cats and dogs . Shahid & Kangana both behaved like spoiled children ,each thrusting their own opinions & trying to go one better than the other. Both have their own issues and have shown many times that they are not team players.That's why no one hires Shahid. So much ego.He is obviously talking about Kangana and Saif not getting along too well with Shahid. Kangana doesn't get along with anyone and Saif has that weird history with Shahid regardless of how much they try to ""act"" like everything is fine. Shahid went on to work with Vishal Bhardwaj again so he likes him!You could tell from the interviews with Shahid and Kangana that he didn't respect her at all. Not listening to what she had to say, only talking about Haider.Shahid is the unfriendly one. He doesn’t have any friends in the industryMeaning shahid and kanganaI thought Shahid and Kangana had scorching hot chemistry. Liked the movie as well.I loved Rangoon.

""I think it was all good fun, it's quite competitive out there as you know and there's going to be words from time to time,"" Hazlewood said.",Cricket Country,"The on-field verbal duel between rival captains Virat Kohli and Tim Paine has been one of the talking points of the second Test in Perth but Australia pacer Josh Hazlewood on Monday played it down, saying it was done in good spirits.ALSO READ: Kohli, Paine come close to chest bumpingDuring the 71st over of the Australia innings bowled by Jasprit Bumrah, the respective captains were seen exchanging words after Kohli decided to field close to the non-striker and on-field umpire Chris Gaffaney warned both the players.But, Hazlewood cautioned against reading too much in the exchange of words between Kohli and Paine. “I think it was all good fun, it’s quite competitive out there as you know and there’s going to be words from time to time but it was all in good spirits,” Hazlewood said.ALSO READ: Australia five wickets from levelling series in Perth“I don’t think we read too much into it, we go about our work as we see fit and the Indians can do what they like. We control what we control and our behaviour is what we control. We’ll worry about that and let everything else take care of itself.”It worked out well for Australia in the end as Kohli was dismissed for 17 in the second innings as India crashed to 55/4 in their chase.But, Hazlewood said Australia were not targeting a single batsman. “No definitely not. I probably see (Cheteshwar) Pujara as the big wicket as far as when I’m bowling, the glue that holds them together I think. He’s batted the most balls this series and scored nearly the most runs.“I see Pujara as a big wicket and Ajinkya Rahane as well. So the nos. 3, 4, 5 as the key wickets and we see it a bit unstable in the other parts of the order. Certainly not all the focus is on Virat Kohli,” he said.Australia were on course for a series-levelling win after reducing India to 112/5 at stumps on day four, but Hazlewood said there were still some work to do for them for another home victory.“I didn’t go to the UAE, so it feels a bit of a long time between wins, but there’s still a lot of work to do tomorrow. Anytime I’m playing in Australia we feel pretty confident, especially the bowlers feel very confident in getting 20 wickets and a result,” he said.“Last year, we got there four times out of five, so we are feeling pretty confident. It’s just putting that into practice more often than not this summer,” he added.Usman Khawaja anchored the Australia innings by scoring 72 and adding as many runs with Paine for the sixth wicket with Australia scoring 243 runs in their second innings, despite Mohammed Shami taking 6/56.“With Steve (Smith) and Dave (Warner) not here, a bit more pressure falls on Usman. I think he’s the most capped batsman with Shaun Marsh. Experience counts a lot in these situations and there are quite a lot of young guys in top six. Usman felt that responsibility a bit more this season and he’s been struggling the first couple of innings but to see him fight today made everyone a bit more relaxed,” the pacer said.“Tim Paine keeps things quite calm and composed and he doesn’t get too flustered at any stages really and you could see that with the bat today, the way he batted and he was pretty unlucky to get that one today. In the field he leads very well, nice and calm.”Hazlewood said Paine was getting more confident as a leader, whether with the bat or in the field. “He’s quite an experienced player, and I think he’s had time out of the game as well, so he knows himself quite well, not just as a cricketer but as a person. So off the field he’s great to talk to about life, and the cricket side takes care of itself. He’s been really great,” he signed off.",https://www.cricketcountry.com/news/verbal-duel-between-virat-kohli-and-tim-paine-done-in-good-spirits-josh-hazlewood-779766?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,
37788,Job platform for mothers 'The Mom Project' raises $8 mn,"US-based job platform for mothers returning to work 'The Mom Project' has raised $8 million in a Series A funding round led by Grotech Ventures and Initialized Capital. Existing investors including Atlanta Seed Company and Engage Ventures also participated. Allison Robinson founded the startup in 2016 during her maternity leave, realising that ""priorities can change after having a child"".",TechCrunch,"If you are a mother who has taken a break from full-time employment to raise kids, you may have also experienced the challenge that is jumping back into the working world after your break.You may find you need more time flexibility; you have been out of the job market for years and so your confidence is knocked; your skills are no longer as relevant as they were before; or you just want to rethink your career; plus many employers — whether they say it or not — seem less interested in you because of all of the above, and no level of burnishing your resume on LinkedIn will help. It can be tough (and I say that from first-hand experience).Now, Chicago-based startup The Mom Project, a platform specifically built to help female knowledge workers find jobs after pausing to raise kids, has raised a little egg of its own to take on this challenge. It’s picked up a Series A of $8 million that it plans to use to bring its job marketplace to more cities — it’s currently in Chicago, Atlanta and San Francisco — and to expand the kinds of services it offers to make the challenge of juggling work and parenthood easier.The funding is being led by Grotech Ventures and Initialized Capital, with another new investor, Aspect Ventures, and previous backers Atlanta Seed Company, Engage Ventures, OCA Ventures, BBG Ventures, IrishAngels and Wintrust Financial also participating.This brings the total raised by The Mom Project  to $11 million, and with 75,000 registered moms and 1,000 companies, including Procter & Gamble, BP, Miller Coors and AT&T, the startup claims it’s now the largest platform of its kind in the U.S.Allison Robinson, the founder and CEO of The Mom Project, said she came up with the idea for the startup in 2016, when she was on maternity leave from a strategy role at Pampers.“I started realising a lot about moms before I became one,” she says about her last role before striking out as an entrepreneur. “But what I hadn’t understood until I was on maternity leave myself was that your priorities can change after having a child.” (She’s pictured up above with her son.)Citing a study she’d seen in the Harvard Business Review that estimated 43 percent of skilled women exit the workforce after having children, Robinson realised there was a gap in the market for those among them who had timed out from returning to their previous roles, but still wanted to make the leap back into working at some point.And she has a point: Not only do people who decide they want to return to work face all of the usual issues of newly needing more time flexibility, wondering whether their skills are still current enough, general confidence and so on, but the average recruitment process, and job sites overall, do not really have ways to account for any of that very well.And the gap exists on the employer side of the marketplace, too. Businesses — both large corporates very much in the public eye as well as smaller businesses that are not — are rethinking how they hire and keep good people in the overall competition for talent. (Just this week, the U.K.’s Office of National Statistics said that the number of unfilled positions in the information and communication technology sector rose by 24.3 percent compared to last year in the country, a shortage that’s reflected in other markets.)Having a diverse workforce — including more women and women from different walks of life — is key not only to helping counteract that, but to contribute to better overall work culture. That’s a fact that many employers have realised independently or have simply been thrown into the spotlight unwittingly and now are trying to repair.And yet, there haven’t been many opportunities for them to pursue more diverse hiring practices.LinkedIn recently made a tiny move into exploring diversity in hiring by at least allowing recruiters to search their job candidate results by gender, but this is a far cry from actually addressing the specific predicaments that particular segments of the working population have, and how to help them connect better with employers who might be keen to bring more of them on through recruitment.In fact, the idea of providing improved job search for knowledge workers in specific cases is actually a very interesting one that shows there is definitely still room for innovation in the world of recruitment: Handshake earlier this year raised $40 million for its own take on this, which is providing a better LinkedIn-style platform to connect minority university graduates with interesting job opportunities at companies keen to make their workforces more diverse.“Companies have started to realize the value in building a diverse workforce, but we still have a long way to go in achieving equal representation and opportunities,” said Julia Taxin, a partner at Grotech and new Mom Project board member. “Allison and her team have built an incredible marketplace of diverse talent for companies and I look forward to working with The Mom Project to execute on their vision of helping to close the gender gap in the workplace.”The Mom Project, Robinson said, is tackling the challenges at both ends of the spectrum.On the employer side, she said there is a lot of educating going on, talking to HR people and getting them to understand the opportunity they could unlock by hiring more parents — which tend to be almost entirely all-women, but sometimes men, too.“We want to provide more data to these companies,” she said, pointing out that it’s not just a matter of providing a job opportunity, but also giving parents options in areas like childcare, or flexible working schedules. “We want to show them ‘here is where you are doing well, and here is where you are not. Fixes don’t cost a lot of money, but a lot of companies are just not aware.”“We’ve got 75,000 women on our platform, and currently around 1,000 companies posting jobs,” she said. “The goal is to have 75,000-plus jobs. We want to make sure that all the moms signing up on the platform are getting work.”“The Mom Project is determined to create a future where women aren’t forced to choose between their families and their careers,” said Alda Leu Dennis, partner at Initialized Capital and new Mom Project board member, in a statement. “There is a huge pool of experienced talent, parents and non-parents, that is sometimes overlooked because companies haven’t created the kind of diverse, flexible workplace culture that attracts and retains them. Initialized wants to be part of making this cultural shift happen.”On the parent side, not only is it also about making the platform known to people who are considering a return to work, but it’s also about some fundamental, but very important basics, such as giving would-be jobseekers the flexibility to go to interviews. Robinson said that one campaign it’s about to launch, in partnership with Urban Sitter, is to provide free childcare credits to Mom Project jobseekers so that they can get to their interview.“Sometimes you have to go to an interview with 24 hours’ notice, and lining up a sitter can be stressful,” she said. “We want to alleviate that.”Parents also know that this isn’t just an issue for the interview: Many towns and regions have what Robinson called “childcare deserts,” where there is a scarcity of affordable options to replace the parent on a more daily basis.For now, Robinson said that the majority of jobs on the platform are focused on fixed-term employment — that is, not permanent, full-time work.This is due to a number of reasons. For example, parents coming back to working after a break may be more inclined to ease in with shorter roles and less long-term commitment. And employers are still testing out how this demographic of workers will work out, so to speak. Equally, though, we have seen a huge swing in more general employment trends, where businesses are hiring fixed-term workers rather than full-time employees to account for seasonality and to give themselves more flexibility (not to mention less liability on the benefits front).While Robinson said that the aim is definitely to bring more full-time job opportunities to the platform over time, this has nonetheless presented an interesting business opportunity to The Mom Project. The startup acts like Airbnb, Amazon and a number of other marketplaces, where it not only connects job-seekers and employers, but also then handles all the transactions around the job. When the job is fixed-term, the Mom Project essentially becomes like the job agency paying the employee, and that is how it makes a cut. And it also becomes the provider of benefits and more.In other words, while there is an immediate opportunity for The Mom Project to compete against (or at least win some business from) the likes of LinkedIn to target the specific opportunity of providing jobs for women returning to work, there is a potentially and equally big one in becoming a one-stop employment shop to handle customers’ other needs as employers or workers, providing a range of other services, from payroll through to childcare listings and more.",https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/17/the-mom-project-a-job-site-for-moms-returning-to-work-nabs-8m-from-initialized-and-more/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,

Warne has been critical of Starc in the past, but the paceman said after play on Sunday he shoulders arms to comments made by the former leg-spinner. ""I still don't know what he said,"" Starc said on Fox Cricket's Cricket 360 program. ""I've been told about it. ""If I keep listening to Warney I may as well retire. ""I'll just keep going about my stuff as I have done over the weeks.""In the time between the first and second Domain Tests, Starc received backing from his captain Tim Paine, teammate Aaron Finch and Test legend Ricky Ponting.  If there was any doubt about Starc's passion or ability, he silenced those calls in his third over with a 145kph in-swinging thunderbolt that splattered the stumps of India opener Murali Vijay.Starc finished with 2-79 from 24 overs and said he was content with how he's been bowling this series. ""I was pretty happy with how I went last week,"" Starc said. ""Take out three overs, perhaps four, out of the 42 that I bowled I was very happy with how (the ball) came out, stuck to my plans and did my job for the team. ""I didn't change anything through the week or didn't try and bowl any differently over the past few days. ""I had a good sit-down chat with Mitch Johnson but we didn't really talk any cricket.

37811,There should have been a spinner: Shami on 2nd Test's team,"Speaking about the Indian team for the ongoing second Test in Perth, pacer Mohammad Shami said, ""We had one spinner who didn't bowl badly. (But) if you ask me, I feel there should have been a frontline spinner."" ""The team management makes these decisions. We can't do anything about it,"" Shami said about the team-selection process.",Times Now,"Perth: Pacer Mohammed Shami on Monday said India missed a trick in not playing a full-time spinner on a pitch where Australia tweaker Nathan Lyon has already bagged seven wickets. Chasing 287, India were reduced to 112 for five at stumps on day four of the second Test at the Optus Stadium.Australia finished with 243 in their second innings, with Shami taking a career-best haul of 6-56 but the match went away from India for the lack of a balanced bowling attack. ""The team management makes these decisions. We can't do anything about it. We had one spinner who didn't bowl badly. (But) If you ask me, I feel there should have been a spinner, but these things depend on your management,"" said Shami.""After such a long time we have an Indian pace attack where all the bowlers are fast and are bowling good lines and lengths. Four years ago we weren't even this experienced. You must have seen the difference in our accuracy from four years ago.""
India lead the four-match series 1-0 after their 31-run win in the opening Test at Adelaide.""It helps a lot to have a good bowler at the other end, who has the same mentality as you and is keeping things tight. ""This keeps the pressure up, and sometimes you don't even realise when the game turns your way. The bowler at the other end is sometimes just as important,"" he added, heaping praise on the fast-bowling unit.Talking about his career-best spell, the pacer said, ""I always try to bowl a good line and length. Rest is up to your luck, how many wickets you get or not. Your approach has to be good. If you are playing Test cricket, you have to focus on your line and length. You will get the wickets automatically.""Sometimes when you have a long partnership, you have to wait, especially on a wicket like this where we were beating them again and again. It wasn't as if we were bowling bad balls, but even on bowling good lengths we were not getting wickets. As soon as we got a wicket the momentum changed and we used it.""India have Hanuma Vihari and Rishabh Pant at the crease, and need 175 runs for victory. The visitors were reduced 55 for four at one stage, with Nathan Lyon dismissing Virat Kohli and Murali Vijay in the space of three overs. Shami said winning or losing isn't important as the team competed well on a tough Perth wicket, which is proving very challenging to batsmen of both sides.""It is part of the game. Winning and losing happens. We will just look forward. ""You can see first two days the wicket was very good. But third day it was going a little up and down, and there was uneven bounce as well. And the ball is keeping low at times as well.""But it is like a normal Perth wicket and that's how it has played so far. It is in everybody's minds that on days 3 and 4 there will be some up and down and we are getting to see this so far,"" he said. Apart from India's collapse the other talking point of the day was the continuing exchange between skipper Tim Paine and Virat Kohli. Umpire Chris Gaffaney had to separate the two at one point.""We cannot say much about it. It is part of the game, but nothing too serious. When you play Test cricket it is a long match and you have a long time so a little bit aggression is there and sometimes you react on the moment. ""We don't need to mind these things too much. It is part of the game. If these things don't happen in the match then I think the match won't be interesting either.""""Maybe in that moment, things get heated up but it is not something to be made a big issue out of. According to me, we should leave this here. The saga continued even when Kohli was dismissed, with Paine sledging Vijay in Kohli's name. Shami said these things shouldn't be taken personally.""I have said earlier too that this is a part of the game and we don't take it personally. If there is no sledging, you won't enjoy the game and the public won't enjoy the game. ""If there is aggression, the match becomes more interesting. It is part of the game as it should be,"" he said, of the Paine comment.""What happens on the outside, what the opposition does, it doesn't affect us. We have to focus on our game and we have to improve our game. Not what step of ours is being watched and what is not,"" he signed off. ",https://www.timesnownews.com/sports/cricket/article/there-should-have-been-a-spinner-says-mohammed-shami/332516?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,

Once, Lyon was hit on the grille, the Aussie spinner received medical attention and everything was clear and he started batting again. The sound the ball made when it jammed into the helmet was scary. Shami had not liked the cut shot played earlier in the over and banged it in. Lyon was backing away again but Shami went for the head this time and pinged the helmet.

Items like bottled water, soda and snacks typically cost less but are bulky and expensive to ship. Amazon will eliminate some items and work with manufacturers or vendors to repackage certain items to increase their profitability.",Engadget,"In its quest to cut costs and maximize profits, Amazon is reportedly looking to eliminate product quantities that it can't make money on. These goods, codenamed CRaP, are offerings that Amazon ""Can't Realize a Profit"" on, once you factor in shipping costs. The Wall Street Journal says that the company is targeting items, like beverages, where the weight and size is too big, and the charge is too low.One example is a six-pack of bottled water from Coca-Cola's Smartwater brand, which costs $6.99 and is available as a Dash button. Water is heavy and doesn't cost a lot, and so it's likely that Amazon was eating much of the delivery charges, much to its distaste. That's why, earlier in the year, the minimum order for the bottles went from a six-pack to a 24-pack, costing $37.20.That doesn't seem to have helped, however, and so Amazon has reportedly asked a number of brands, including Coca-Cola, to ship their own products. The paper says that only a company with the size and muscle of Amazon could get away with such a request. And the report goes on to say that initiatives like Prime Pantry, where users have to fill a box with goods before shipping, is another way to mitigate costs.It'll be interesting to see how this conflicts with the whole point of the Dash button, which was about avoiding bulk buying. After all, there's little point in a button that you can get a near-instant refill of your laundry detergent if you have to buy it by the gallon, rather than by the pint.",https://www.engadget.com/2018/12/17/amazon-declares-war-on-loss-making-crap/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,

Careem plans to invest over $150 million to develop its delivery business. Egypt and Pakistan will come next and then very soon the rest of the footprint will follow, CEO and Co-Founder Mudassir Sheikha said.",Reuters,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Careem launched a delivery service covering everything from takeaway food to pharmaceuticals on Monday, diversifying from its core Middle East ride-hailing business and increasing competition with rival Uber Technologies. The company has expanded its car service business to more than 120 cities in 15 predominantly Middle East countries since launching in 2012.  “We believe the opportunity for deliveries in the region is even bigger than ride-hailing,” Chief Executive and Co-Founder Mudassir Sheikha told Reuters at Careem’s headquarters in Dubai. “It is going to become a very significant part of Careem over time.” It plans to spend over $150 million developing the delivery business, starting with food delivery services in Dubai and Jeddah. “Once you see us prove the model in the UAE (United Arab Emirates) and Saudi (Arabia), you will see us very quickly go to new markets,” Sheikha said. “Egypt and Pakistan will come next and then very soon the rest of the footprint will follow.”         Careem, whose investors include German car maker Daimler and China’s largest ride-hailing company DiDi Chuxing, has trialled food delivery since acquiring an online restaurant listing platform in February. It also offers digital payment services.   The Careem NOW delivery service is a separate app to the car service and will be operated independently to the core business with Adeeb Warsi appointed as managing director. Warsi joined Careem in 2017 after more than seven years with the Boston Consulting Group, according to his LinkedIn profile. In October, Careem said it had raised over $200 million from existing investors to fund its expansion. Careem will “most likely” close out the funding round in the first quarter next year, raising a total of $500 million, including what was raised in October, Sheikha said. Reuters reported in November Careem was looking to raise up to $200 million from Chinese investors, and that it has been working with investment bank Jefferies as an adviser on investment options and fundraising, including a potential mergers and acquisition deal in the region with Uber. “Discussions have happened with multiple parties in the context of our fundraising,” Sheikha said. “There is a lot of interest to own a piece of the Middle East internet opportunity.”  He declined comment when asked if Uber could be a potential investor. Uber also declined to comment.

37829,Never felt objectified: Katrina on Johar's remark on Chikni Chameli,"Katrina Kaif has said she never felt ""objectified"" in 'Chikni Chameli' but instead enjoyed doing the song. Her statement comes after filmmaker Karan Johar earlier apologised for including 'item songs' like 'Chikni Chameli' in his films. ""Every song that a woman is celebrating herself...that's not objectifying women. It all depends on the angle and lens it's being seen,"" said Katrina.",Times Now,"Filmmaker, actor, talk show host, radio jockey and the chief of Dharma Productions, Karan Johar has been very vocal when it comes to issues of women empowerment. While the filmmaker was quite supportive and lauded the #MeToo movement that took Bollywood by storm, the actor recently, in an interview with Anupama Chopra also revealed his pledge to never have another item song in the Dharma movies.According to the director, item songs are meant specifically for women to be objectified. Add to that, the fashionista also insisted that item songs have no role in furthering the plot of the film or have any significance, instead it is just a means to promote the film and entice the male audience. Furthermore, the word item too is demeaning to women as it means to belittle a woman and make her sound attractive and promiscuous. (Also Read: Waiting for a Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara sequel? Here's what Katrina Kaif has to say about it)Item songs indeed are full of vulgar lyrics and shot in a way that keeps the focus on various body parts of the performer resulting in sexually-charged visual. And not just Dharma Productions, but several big and small banner films have used this as an integral tool to market it. However, Katrina Kaif, the actress who has done several item numbers in her career including the most popular ones – Sheila Ki Jawaani and Chikni Chameli, disagreed with Karan’s verdict on item numbers.In an interview with the DNA, Katrina said the following:
 “Oh, I didn't know that was said, but I feel very differently on the matter. I feel it's all down to the individual who is performing the song. Madonaa, who I'm sure we all know of, I don't think she is feeling objectified. I don't think Beyonce who performs in a swimsuit on stage is feeling objectified. It's all about how you feel while you are performing that song. I can tell you, I never felt objectified in 'Chikni Chameli'. I enjoyed that song. I enjoyed the dance, I enjoyed what I was doing. I didn't even for a moment felt objectified or brought any kind of wrong eyes on me. Not at all...There are many times when people ask me for songs and there's no context to it. I won't do it, nomatter how much I feel about dance. We don't need to characterize it that every song that a woman is celebrating herself and performing, that's not objectifying women. It all depends on the angle and lens it's being seen.”
 
Earlier, Karan Johar had told Anupama Chopra the following:
 ""I have gone on record and apologized that I have had item songs in my feature films and I don't think I would do it again. I have no problem with like a girl dancing, that's not an item number. An item song is when she is objectified and when there are men lusting for her like 'Chikni Chameli'. I don't think I would ever do that again. It's never gonna happen in a Dharma Productions film and I will make sure of it. Like 'Desi Girl' is not an item song but 'Chikni Chameli' is. And, I don't think I would do it. I have grown up singing to 'Khambe Jaisi Khadi Hai, Ladki Hai Ya Chadi Hai' and I didn't even realize what those words are. Then you suddenly sing that song and you are like, 'Oh My God! This is so misogynistic'. And, it's absolutely ridiculous that we have done it and a lead actor like Aamir Khan had danced on that song. He himself, on my show, has actually said that 'I did this and I apologise like I wouldn't do it again'. We don't even think what these words are. Like I've no problem with brilliantly written and a beautiful song. Just the way how Gulzar saab wrote the songs of 'Omkara'. They are stunning! 'Zabaan Pe Lagaa, Lagaa Re, Namak Ishq Ka' - is beautiful. Even 'Bidi Jalaile'. It's the way you picturize a song like that. You've got to kind of make sure that you don't because eventually we are a very impressionable medium.""
 Well, Karan, it seems like you may have been looking at item numbers through just a single lens and Katrina’s perspective too should be considered and evaluated. Meanwhile, Katrina will be seen next in the upcoming Aanand L. Rai film Zero which also stars Shah Rukh Khan and Anushka Sharma while Karan Johar’s Dharma Productions’ release Simmba will hit theatres on December 28 which stars Ranveer Singh and Sara Ali Khan.",https://www.timesnownews.com/entertainment/news/bollywood-news/article/katrina-kaif-strongly-reacts-on-karan-johars-pledge-to-never-have-a-chikni-chameli-like-song-in-his-movies/332095?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,

The round values Byju's at nearly $4 billion, making it one of India's most-valuable startups, according to reports. Byju's was founded in 2008 by Byju Raveendran as an offline teaching centre.",TechCrunch,"India-based educational startup Byju’s was widely reported to have raised a massive $400 million round, and now the company is making things official. The 10-year-old company revealed today it has pulled in a total of $540 million from investors to go after international opportunities.The round is led by Naspers,  the investment firm famous for backing Tencent that also includes educational firms Udemy, Codecademy and Brainly among its portfolio. The Canadian Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) provided “a significant portion” of the round, according to an announcement that also revealed the deal included some secondary share sales. A source told TechCrunch that’s from Sequoia India, an early investor that is cashing in a piece of its winnings.This round takes Byju’s to $775 million from investors to date. Its backers include Tencent, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative  — from Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg  and his wife — General Atlantic, IFC, Lightspeed Ventures and Times Internet.The deal takes the company valuation to nearly $4 billion, a source told TechCrunch. That’s in line with what was reported by India media last week and it represents a major jump on the $800 million valuation that it commanded when it raised money from Tencent in July 2017. It also makes Byju’s India’s fourth highest-valued tech startup behind only Paytm, Ola and OYO.Founded in 2008 by Byju Raveendran as on offline teaching center, it moved into digital courses as recently as 2015. The company specializes in grades 4-12 educational courses that use a combination of videos and other materials. Besides courses, the service covers exams, free courses and paid-for courses.Byju’s says that 30 million students have registered for its online educational service. Dhiraj Singh/BloombergByju’s says that 30 million students have registered for its online educational service. Dhiraj Singh/BloombergIt claims to have registered more than 30 million students, while more than two million customers have signed up for an annual paid subscription to date. Raveendran told TechCrunch in an interview that there are currently around 1.3 million paying users. He said that the service enjoys a renewal rate of around 80 percent, and that it is adding 1.5-2 million new students per month, some 150,000 of which are part of paying packages.This new money will go toward globalizing the service beyond India, with a number of courses in English for children aged 3-8, an entirely new category for the company, set to launch next year. Those will include Math and Science.Raveendran told TechCrunch that the service will target English-speaking markets, as well as other major international countries, including India.“There’s a growing percentage of people wanting to learn English or [in countries where] it is becoming aspirational. Slowly but surely it is happening around the world,” he said in an interview.The company will release the new services at the beginning of local academic years — which vary worldwide — with the aim of appealing directly to kids. If the youngsters enjoy the app, parents can buy the full experience for them. It’s a logical way to find a global audience — families prepared to spend on English tuition exist worldwide — whilst also expanding into a new customer base that could become users of the core Byju’s service.While the company has developed the core content aspect of the service, Raveendran said he is on the lookout for acquisitions and partnerships that can add more to the appeal.“They will all be product-based acquisitions that will be value-adds on top of our core product,” he said. “Over the last 12 months, we’ve scouted for core product acquisitions but went the other way around and decided to build it ourselves.”Further down the line, Byju’s may develop more localized services in countries where it sees high demand for the children’s product, Raveendran added.Byju Raveendran started the company 10 years ago, but it entered the digital education space in 2015 [Photographer: Dhiraj Singh/Bloomberg/Getty Images]Byju Raveendran started the company 10 years ago, but it entered the digital education space in 2015 [Photographer: Dhiraj Singh/Bloomberg/Getty Images]That expansion is likely to be influenced by Naspers, which has a very global portfolio, including deals in emerging markets like Southeast Asia, Latin America, Africa and Eastern Asia. Indeed, the deal sees Russell Dreisenstock — head of international investments for Naspers — join the Byju’s board.Tencent also has experience and connections, having backed China’s Yuanfudao education platform, which is now reportedly valued around $2.8 billion. Alongside Sequoia — another Byju’s investor — it is also part of VIPKid, a hugely successful platform that connects U.S.-based teachers with English language learners in China.Despite that, Raveendran said those investments are unlikely to be core to this global push.“We expect [our investors] to help us finding partners through portfolio companies or others [but] there is no significant overlap with what we will do,” he explained.In the case of VIPKid, he said that if Byju’s “ever decides to do anything in China” then it is likely that it will complement VIPKid’s tutor-led approach to learning rather than take it on directly.Still, Raveendran expects the global business to become profitable and self-sustaining within the next three years. Already, the India-based business is profitable as of this year, he said, but its appeal has grown globally somewhat even before this new product launch. Overseas is currently 15 percent of revenue, a figure that the CEO puts down to the Indian diaspora globally.Note, 12/17 03:58 PST: Article updated to explain that the English services will be Math and Science.",https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/17/byjus-raises-540-million/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,
37836,Ex-Aus captain Steve Smith leads club side to T20 title,"Australia's former captain Steve Smith, who is serving a suspension from international cricket, led his club side Sutherland to the title of NSW Premier T20 champions. Smith has been barred from holding a leadership position in international and domestic cricket for another 12 months after his suspension lapses. Smith's suspension is set to end in March.",Cricket Australia,"As Virat Kohli made his not-so-subtle gesture to a global television audience on reaching a majestic century on Sunday, the man universally regarded as his only peer for the title of this generation's leading batsmen marked a milestone of his own in more low-key circumstances.While the Australian team he used to lead was searching for a way to penetrate Kohli's defences in Perth, Steve Smith was at the SCG leading his club side Sutherland to the title of NSW Premier T20 champions.Not only were the semi-final and final of the competition Smith’s first matches back on a major Australian cricket ground since his year-long domestic and international ban was imposed in March, it was also the first time he’s captained a team since the ball-tampering scandal. Although he's barred from holding a leadership position in international and domestic cricket for another 12 months after his suspension lapses, there were no such issues with him filling in as club skipper on Sunday.Smith cut a contented figure as he strode to the middle and discussed field settings with opening bowler Jake Wilson for his side’s first match of the day.If he allowed himself to momentarily imagine he was wearing his Baggy Green again instead of the baby-blue colours of Sutherland, he was quickly brought back to earth following a farcical delay that put play on hold for almost 30 minutes.The electronic sight screen at the southern end of the historic ground proved immovable three overs into St George's innings when off-spinner Tom Doyle opted to bowl around the wicket. It left ground staff and Sutherland players with no choice but to manually unpin the enormous white sheet draped over the Victor Trumper Stand's empty seats and force the batters to do their best to sight the ball out of the blue seats.It was a far cry from the attention to detail Smith is used to at the higher levels of cricket, not that he seemed to mind.The 29-year-old rolled out four overs of leg-spin for the reward of two wickets - and watched as teammate Austin Waugh plucked an outfield screamer - before he got his turn to do what he loves the most.Batting at No.3 and with all his idiosyncrasies on display, Smith took to the task of chasing down a modest total of 112 with trademark attention to detail. A cut shot marked his first and only four of the knock, his only other 'boundary' being a close-run two that ricocheted off Doyle's helmet and away for four overthrows.He ticked himself off when he hit a ball to the man at cover, forcefully displaying with his gloved left hand how he'd meant to hit the ball in the gap to the fielder's right.From 4-62, Smith expertly manoeuvered the field with ones and twos, reaching 42 off only 44 deliveries by the time Doyle hit the winning runs with 12 balls to spare.Smith’s subsequent innings in a tense final victory over Sydney University was briefer and more eventful.His opponents were convinced they had him out first ball when a brute of a delivery from Uni paceman Ben Joy struck him on the shoulder and ballooned for a catch, with replays on Cricket NSW's live stream showing the correct call of not out had been made. A glorious square cut followed a less-then-glorious French cut, before Joy nicked him off for 19 as Sutherland claimed the trophy thanks to a five-wicket win.Almost a year after he’d held aloft the replica Ashes urn and celebrated with his teammates in front of the SCG Members’ Stand, Smith stood in the same spot and received a premiership cup in front of a smattering of loyal club players and supporters.Having been forced to ply his trade in far-flung venues in Toronto, Barbados and suburban grounds around Sydney during his exile, this was a triumphant return to familiar surrounds.""I know these conditions pretty well,"" Smith said with childlike enthusiasm between matches.But it was a continent away from where he would have been most comfortable.At almost the exact same time as Smith removed his helmet to shake hands after Sutherland's semi-final win, Kohli was toasting his 25th Test hundred – a tally now two higher than Smith's – by making a talking gesture with his hand and pointing to his bat. The world will have to wait patiently for Smith's response.",https://www.cricket.com.au/news/steve-smith-scg-sydney-premier-t20-cricket-club-grade-championships-virat-kohli/2018-12-17?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,

Incidentally, Karan Johar was named Rahul Kumar Johar and that was his official name for the first 12 days of his life. Fortunately for him, it was then changed to Karan as we now know him.The filmmaker also revealed that his mother Hiroo Johar had a dream and that is what made her change his name from Rahul Kumar to just Karan.

On my janam patri, it still says Rahul Kumar Johar,"" Karan revaled on the show while also adding that his full name is actually Karan Kumar Johar.
 
Both Vicky Kaushal and Ayushmann Khurrana burst into laughter upon this revelation and the former even cracked a joke telling Karan that his new initials should be ‘KKJo’ instead of the existing one – KJo. This revelation was a result of Ayushmann’s revelation that he was named Nishant initially and later it was changed to Ayushmann Khurrana.

Again, it was the India captain Virat Kohli taking on his opposite number Tim Paine.

The hosts have slowly and steadily batted themselves out of danger and got into a position of strength. Their lead has gone past 200-run-mark and India has got no wickets on the first session on Day 4. It seems to be frustrating Kohli and that may have been a major reason why the Indian captain got down to verbal blows.

Michael Hussey said that he did not like Kohli’s attitude, whereas Allan Border said that he had never seen any captain behave in the manner Kohli was.Here is what happened.Earlier, Tim Paine and Usman Khawaja frustrated India with an unbeaten 70-run stand, helping Australia extend their lead to 233 after a wicket-less morning session on day four of the second Test on Monday.

37860,Tamil Nadu IAS officer surprises girl whom he helped in 2004 tsunami,"Tamil Nadu IAS officer and Health Secretary J Radhakrishnan recently surprised 16-year-old Meena at her school, whom he helped during the 2004 tsunami. Meena was two years old when she was brought to Radhakrishnan by the locals after they found her alone under a bridge. On government's order, Radhakrishnan set up an orphanage for Meena and 98 other tsunami-affected kids.",The News Minute,"Tamil Nadu Health Secretary Dr J Radhakrishnan was visiting a nearby town when he realised that he hadn’t met Meenu for more than 3 years. He decided to drop in to meet her as a surprise, and when they met, she called him “Appa”, and he turned emotional and his eyes welled up. Meena, or Meenu as he likes to endearingly call her, is the baby girl he had rescued in Nagapattinam during the deadly Tsunami 14 years ago. The two hadn’t met since 2015 until the top officer decided to surprise her by dropping in at her school during an official trip.“I was on a visit to Sithathur. Suddenly, I realised that I hadn’t seen Meenu in so long. I immediately called up the Natarajan Damayanti School where she studies and said I am coming to visit,” Radhakrishnan told TNM.  The meeting ended with both the bureaucrat and the now 16-year-old Meenu laughing, sobbing, recollecting memories and discussing her future until he had to bid adieu. “She even called me Appa,” Radhakrishnan adds happily.Fourteen years ago, it was destiny and a group of well-meaning locals who brought Meena into Radhakrishnan’s life, a gesture he can perhaps never forget. Found alone under a run-down bridge near Keechankuppam days after the Tsunami battered the coastal town of Nagapattinam, the toddler was handed over to the care of Radhakrishnan and his wife. “I was then the collector of Thanjavur and had come to Nagapattinam to help with rescue operations. Meenu was 2 years old and soon became my wife’s favourite,” Radhakrishnan adds. In 2004, the Tsunami claimed more than 6,000 lives in Nagapattinam alone. Countless houses were lost, 73 seaside settlements washed away and nearly 2 lakh people were put up in relief camps across the state. Out of this, there were 99 little boys and girls in the district who lost either one or both parents to the disaster. Bereft of a family, these children’s future was in the government’s hands.“The former CM late J Jayalalithaa called me and asked me to help set up an orphanage under the Tsunami Rehabilitation Project for these kids immediately. Thus, the Annai Sathya Illam was built, where the children found a home,” he says. For the first few years, Radhakrishnan and his wife would visit every week. Over the years, this reduced to once a year and then once in two or three years. The children were put in the able hands of Social Welfare officer late Suryakala at the orphanage. “With Meena being the youngest of the lot, she was everyone’s pet,” Radhakrishnan adds. “My wife and I would keep going to meet all the children. One of us would carry Meena while we played with the other children. Now almost all of have left the orphanage,” he says.Some of the children at the orphanage found new homes after their extended families claimed them in the subsequent months. Others who were older went away to study and eventually moved out of the Illam after getting married. Meena is the last of the 99 original children who are staying at the hostel. She is in class 11 and wants to study commerce after completing high school. “No one ever came to claim her. Sometimes, I feel the trail of a natural disaster dies down over the years. But then I rethink when I see kids like her,” Radhakrishnan adds.",https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/when-meenu-met-appa-tn-ias-officer-surprises-toddler-he-saved-2004-tsunami-93458?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,

In an EXCLUSIVE interaction with Pinkvilla, Manikarnika producer Kamal Jain spoke about how both Kangana and Krish will get directing credits in the trailer. Kamal shared, ""After Krish had other commitments and we saw the film, we felt that it has to really go further. We can't go with an average film as it's a tribute to Rani Laxmibai. It has to be the best. We decided to push the envelope further and reshoot or shoot new portions."" Talking about how Kangana took over, Kamal said, ""Since Krish was not available, Kangana Ranaut was the most suitable one because she has been living the film, since forever. Creatively, she is inclined and has taken onus on herself. She has done everything with passion and interest. I was also there throughout and we collaborated the entire process. She did the entire direction. Every part of the filmmaking - be it costume, art, direction, camera angles, she's been very professional and proficient. We never felt this was her first movie as a director. To helm such a big scale of the film is not easy and she is acting also along with direction and writing. It was really good. As a producer, I believe that even if someone has worked on my film for just a day, I have to give credit to them. Kangana has shot more than 70 percent of the film. There is no way that we can't give credit to her. It will be absolutely unethical and unfair on my part as a producer. Even if she would have told me, 'No, don't give my name,' I would have given her credit.""Kamal concluded by talking about the trailer launch as he revealed, ""Whatever the outcome of the film is now extraordinary.

An iPhone X was the only phone that defended against the attack while the Android phones just displayed warnings about the insecurity of facial recognition. The reality with any biometrics is that they can be copied, cybersecurity firm NCC Group's Research Director Matthew Lewis said.",TechCrunch,"There’s a lot you can make with a 3D printer: prosthetics, corneas, firearms — even an Olympic-standard luge.You can even 3D-print a life-size replica of a human head — and not just for Hollywood. Forbes reporter Thomas Brewster commissioned a 3D-printed model of his own head to test the face unlocking systems on a range of phones — four Android models and an iPhone X.Bad news if you’re an Android user: only the iPhone X defended against the attack.Gone, it seems, are the days of the trusty passcode, which many still find cumbersome, fiddly and inconvenient — especially when you unlock your phone dozens of times a day. Phone makers are taking to the more convenient unlock methods. Even if Google’s latest Pixel 3 shunned facial recognition, many Android models — including popular Samsung devices — are relying more on your facial biometrics. In its latest models, Apple effectively killed its fingerprint-reading Touch ID in favor of its newer Face ID.But that poses a problem for your data if a mere 3D-printed model can trick your phone into giving up your secrets. That makes life much easier for hackers, who have no rulebook to go from. But what about the police or the feds, who do?It’s no secret that biometrics — your fingerprints and your face — aren’t protected under the Fifth Amendment. That means police can’t compel you to give up your passcode, but they can forcibly depress your fingerprint to unlock your phone, or hold it to your face while you’re looking at it. And the police know it — it happens more often than you might realize.But there’s also little in the way of stopping police from 3D-printing or replicating a set of biometrics to break into a phone.“Legally, it’s no different from using fingerprints to unlock a device,” said Orin Kerr, professor at USC Gould School of Law, in an email. “The government needs to get the biometric unlocking information somehow,” by either the finger pattern shape or the head shape, he said.Although a warrant “wouldn’t necessarily be a requirement” to get the biometric data, one would be needed to use the data to unlock a device, he said.Jake Laperruque, senior counsel at the Project On Government Oversight, said it was doable but isn’t the most practical or cost-effective way for cops to get access to phone data.“A situation where you couldn’t get the actual person but could use a 3D print model may exist,” he said. “I think the big threat is that a system where anyone — cops or criminals — can get into your phone by holding your face up to it is a system with serious security limits.”The FBI alone has thousands of devices in its custody — even after admitting the number of encrypted devices is far lower than first reported. With the ubiquitous nature of surveillance, now even more powerful with high-resolution cameras and facial recognition software, it’s easier than ever for police to obtain our biometric data as we go about our everyday lives.Those cheering on the “death of the password” might want to think again. They’re still the only thing that’s keeping your data safe from the law.FBI reportedly overestimated inaccessible encrypted phones by thousands",https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/16/3d-printed-heads-unlock-cops-hackers/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,

The comments represented a notable hardening in tone from Trudeau, who previously said there would be huge penalties for scrapping the $13 billion agreement for armored vehicles made by the Canadian unit of General Dynamics Corp. Last month, Trudeau said Canada could freeze the relevant export permits if it concluded the weapons had been misused. “We are engaged with the export permits to try and see if there is a way of no longer exporting these vehicles to Saudi Arabia,” Trudeau told CTV. He did not give further details. Political opponents, citing the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi and Saudi Arabia’s involvement in the Yemen war, insist Trudeau should end the General Dynamics deal, which was negotiated by the previous Conservative government. Relations between Ottawa and Riyadh have been tense since a diplomatic dispute over human rights earlier this year. Ottawa says it has been consulting allies on what steps to take after Khashoggi was killed inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. “The murder of a journalist is absolutely unacceptable and that’s why Canada from the very beginning had been demanding answers and solutions on that,” said Trudeau.

To do this, the company had to push its rocket motor to the longest burn duration yet, 'resulting in us going higher than we have before''Incremental flight test programs are by definition open-ended and, to a great extent, each test depends on the data from the test that precedes it,' Galactic said regarding this week's test.'There is no guarantee that everything will work perfectly first time and, like all programs seeking to take bold steps, we will inevitably have times when things don't go as planned.'   The fledgling space firm also carried four research payloads that are part of the NASA Flight Opportunities Program.This was Virgin Galactic's first mission for NASA, and the space agency purchased flight services, the accommodation and ride, from Virgin Galactic for the payloads. SpaceX Starship Mk1 blows its top during cryogenic pressure testGamma ray burst breaks record for brightest light ever seenLive stream captures moment SpaceX's Starship Mk1's top blows offAustralian scientists test new shark-proof wetsuit materialImperial College examine how DMT changes brainwaves to 'dream-state'Heliogen's AI mirrors generate heat to make cement and steelSony cooks up special AI that aims to change the way people eatVR patch can allow you to feel touch from anywhere in the worldThis is what 'artificial skin' is made up of, creating VR touchVan driver rams car into a motorway barrier in 'road rage attack'Horrific video shows moment man shoots woman dead in BrazilMums brawl in front of terrified children outside primary schoolThree companies are leading the charge in commercial space travel as they race to get tourists beyond orbit.Tesla CEO Elon Musk's firm SpaceX, Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin are all vying to be the first companies to send up the first commercial space flight.But while Sir Richard believes Musk is 'doing fantastically well' in getting cargo into space - including his own car - the real tussle is between the Virgin boss and Bezos.Musk has reached dizzying heights with his numerous private space deliveries to the International Space Station at an altitude of around 1.4 million feet (408,000 metres), but is yet to fly any of his planned passenger-carrying craft.Blue Origin flew its New Shepherd spacepod, which launches aboard a traditional rocket capsule, to an altitude of 351,000 feet (107,000 metres) during a test flight near Van Horn, Texas, on April 29 (pictured)Virgin Galactic reached a top altitude of 170,800 feet (52,000 metres) during a test of its VSS Unity spacecraft, which has room for six passenger and is lifted toward space on a huge carrier aricraft, on May 29.Eventually, the company wants to fly space tourists to an altitude of 360,890 feet (110,000 metres) going beyond the 328,000 feet (100,000 metres) defined boundary of space. Blue Origin flew its New Shepherd spacepod, which launches aboard a traditional rocket capsule, to an altitude of 351,000 feet (107,000 metres) during a test flight near Van Horn, Texas, on April 29.The reusable New Shepard rocket and spacecraft is intended to carry up to six space tourists, researchers and/or experiments on brief suborbital flights, the company has said. Virgin Galactic, founded by Branson in 2004, is working to carry tourists on a brief journey to space, dozens of miles above the Earth's surface.Tourists will spend several minutes floating in zero gravity, aboard a spaceship that approaches or passes through the Karman line, the boundary of Earth's atmosphere and space, some 62 miles (100 kilometers) high.For comparison, astronauts at the orbiting International Space Station fly some 250 miles (400 km) above Earth.The company first promised to fly tourists into space by the start of 2009, but multiple delays and a fatal test flight crash in 2014 have pushed its first spaceflight back numerous times.SpaceShipTwo safely touched back down to Earth less than 15 minutes after achieving its highest flight yet and hitting speeds of nearly three times the speed of sound The fledgling space firm also carried four research payloads that are part of the NASA Flight Opportunities Program. This was Virgin Galactic's first mission for NASA, and the space agency purchased flight services, the accommodation and ride, from Virgin Galactic for the payloadsVirgin Galactic completed its first supersonic flight since the infamous crash, which killed one test pilot and severely injured another, earlier this year, bringing it closer to its goal of offering commercial spaceflight to the 600 patrons who have paid $250,000 for a ride.Branson said 'ultimately' he would like to see the price fall to around £30,000 ($40,000) or £38,000 ($50,000) over the next ten years.Plans call for six passengers and two pilots to ride the SpaceShipTwo VSS Unity, which resembles a private jet. SpaceX Starship Mk1 blows its top during cryogenic pressure testGamma ray burst breaks record for brightest light ever seenLive stream captures moment SpaceX's Starship Mk1's top blows offAustralian scientists test new shark-proof wetsuit materialImperial College examine how DMT changes brainwaves to 'dream-state'Heliogen's AI mirrors generate heat to make cement and steelSony cooks up special AI that aims to change the way people eatVR patch can allow you to feel touch from anywhere in the worldThis is what 'artificial skin' is made up of, creating VR touchVan driver rams car into a motorway barrier in 'road rage attack'Horrific video shows moment man shoots woman dead in BrazilMums brawl in front of terrified children outside primary school",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-6492453/Virgin-Galactic-attempt-fly-tourist-rocket-edge-space-TODAY.html?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,

Four months in, Hughes suffered a medical emergency and needed to return to the US as soon as possible, but Sesay wasn't able to go back with her.

She managed to convince a man she didn't know to take on the task. Sesay learned 15 years later that that man was Tom Perriello (above), a former Virginia congressman Recounting the story to BuzzFeed News, Sesay said she rushed to the airport and asked a ticket counter employee to point out anyone who was traveling to the US.   The employee initially told Sesay that it was against the airline's policy to provide that information, but eventually directer her to one man after some convincing.  'I walked over to this gentleman and asked if he could travel with Maya,' Sesay told BuzzFeed. 'At first he said no, saying he was traveling to the US for a funeral.'She said somehow she was able to convince him to fly the youngster back to meet relatives in Maryland.  'I stood by and watched the plane took off and not realizing I had handed my kid off to a complete stranger,' she said. 'It was adrenaline, I wasn't in the right state of mind and I wasn't thinking properly ... and that was the end of it. I never again saw this man.' Hughes is now 20 years old and living in California. She said of Perriello: 'There’s a huge possibility I wouldn’t be here today if this man didn’t bring me back over here'Hughes recalled the day as 'a lot of chaos and crying nonstop on the plane' and said the man sang to her on the plane to calm her down.  She wrote on Twitter: 'My mom has been trying to find this man for 15 years, we never got his name or anything. 'So like a week ago my mom found him through a family member who actually worked with him and she said he matched the description and everything.'The man in question is Tom Perriello, a representative from Virginia who worked with former President Barack Obama's administration.Sesay emailed him and the pair have been in touch since Monday.  She said Perriello has been filling her in on parts of the journey from Sierra Leone to Virginia that she never knew about.'This man having accepted a kid from a complete stranger, it's a testament to the kind of person he is,' Sesay said.Sesay reached out to Perriello over email and the pair have been in communication on Monday.

I’m so so grateful!!!!!!!'  Perriello, who is now executive director of the Open Society Foundation, retweeted Hughes' thread and wrote: 'One of the craziest experiences of my entire life is now a Twitter thread - and I could not be happier to know you are shining bright, @_themayan_!'    Perriello told BuzzFeed: 'It's an incredibly vivid memory that seems like something out of a movie. It just wasn't clear if it was a happy movie or a sad movie.' He said of leaving the girl with Sesay's mother at Washington Dulles International airport: 'One of the happier moments in my life was seeing Maya run into her grandmother's arms.'  Hughes and Sesay both told BuzzFeed they are hopeful that they will someday be able to meet Perriello in person. 'For 15 years I was looking for this ghost,' Sesay said. 'I hope to meet with him to get the opportunity to shake his hand, hug him, and thank him for having done that.' Hughes remarked: 'He's a genuinely good person, which is something we don't have a lot of anymore.'If it wasn't for him I don't know how I would've made it back.

See the movie again the acting which he has done, None of them can come even close to his acting...agree there were many films with good actors but the acting which he did was way beyond expectation... So stop judging....i don't have any hatred for alia or something but honestly, she didn't deserve the award. Deepika truly deserved it. She and the film had an impact on people which 'alia' didn't have If you ignore the trolls on padmavat it was well deserving for best film. Stree and padmavat should have gone for a tie in this category. Stop buying awards and present it to them who truly deserve it (sensible actors like amir have stopped attending such fake shows )Ranveer is loud, over-the-top, boisterous and annoying. He's doing what SRK did.... buying his best actor awards.
Can't stand Ranveer.
Ranbir should have got best actor for Sanju.Extremely sad that tabu was not given any award for andhadhun.Tabu deserve award for her outstanding performancesI said it earlier too they should have given Sonam best actress award for Neerja,as Alia would get more opportunities,plus she was nothing great to talk about in..
Ranbir refused to attend the function and so it went to RSNeither of them deserved the award!
Rani, Tapsee, Deepika, Tabu, Ayushman etc. all had more mature performances.Alia truly well deserveAlia truly well deserveAlia truly well deserveI thought deepika’s performance was really understated and powerful ...not a lot of actresses could have carried it off with as much grace ...xAyushman khurrana should have got an award.his acting is marvelous in andhadunAyushman khurrana should have got an award.his acting is marvelous in andhadunRambir didnt attend so the award went to RS.Its fact that Alia is always backed by K.Jo and is probably the obvious example of Nepotism. And her offscreen life is also somewhat irritating too. But I think too much unnecessary hate has messed up all minds if they are saying alia didn't deserve award. I mean come on, its best actress award and whether you like it or not, she acted superior in movie.Don't be blinded by hatred. Give her credit where she deserves... pv plz post.ayushman, ranbir and raj k deserved... tabu, rani & alia also ok..even tapsee deserved. ranveer singh? dont know why...atleast they didnt give jahnvi.Ranveer Singh should get the Actor in a negative role - he has learnt trade of tricks pretty much on how to buy awards!
Alia did not deserve this award.
Ayushmann needed to have some award - they could have created a category for him!! Same thing for Tapsee....Aayushman n Vicky didn't get any awards?Fair.. Except Alia.How much did Karan Johar pay for Alia's award?!Alia deserved for raazi as an actor imo (forget the personal front quotient), And glad stree won. And radhika and ishaan too deserved. I feel pretty much the all winners deserved.Alia does not deserve her award. Rani or Tabu should have won!Rani mukerji is deserve best actress award for hichki.I'm okay with alia for raazi. but Ranveer should have gotten best villain. That's messed up star screenKJo will ensure his daughter will keep getting best actress awards for the next 25 years! He will lobby for all roles for her!!So glad the debut award went to radhikaStree won big wooohooo! I’m so happy pankaj tripathi and rajkumar rao won they were awesome :-)ALIA ARE YOU KIDDING ME? DEEPIKA WAS SO MUCH BETTER IN IN PADMAAVATThese all awards show are fake for best actor there were more deserving actors like Aushman Khurana for Andhadhun and badhaiho,Ranbir kapoor for sanjuSounds fair except for a category is funny to give an award to Katina.. I feel like they should have also given an award to Ayushmaan khurana for Andhadhun along with RajKumar Rao.I am impressed! All given awards were well deserved, except the one they gave to Kat. Pretty sure they just made up a category just so they could give her an award.Agree...but Ayushman deserves betterI'd agree.
Except for Raazi/AliaI agree 100% with everything you saidPlease who decide winners? Is there some kind of panel?",https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/news/star-screen-awards-2018-winners-list-alia-bhatt-wins-best-actress-award-ranveer-singh-bags-best-actor-award?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,

Kushwaha met Congress MP Ahmed Patel at the latter’s residence in Delhi on Saturday.Kushwaha said, “I cannot reveal any details… but joining the mahagathbandhan is one of the many options before our party. We have not taken a final decision so far.” Refusing to divulge any further on all three RLSP members in Bihar’s bicameral legislature raising a banner of revolt, accusing him of pursuing his “personal interests” and declaring that they would remain in the NDA.At the RLSP ‘Milan Samaroh’, Kushwaha tried to tone down the differences within his party.

The Senate had backed a resolution blaming Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for Khashoggi's murder. It also called on Saudi to hold accountable anyone responsible for his death.",Reuters,"RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia on Monday denounced U.S. Senate resolutions calling for an end to U.S. military support for the war in Yemen and blaming Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, saying they were based on unsubstantiated claims. The votes last Thursday were a rare rebuke to President Donald Trump, but largely symbolic. To become law, they would need to pass the House of Representatives, whose Republican leaders have blocked any legislation intended to rebuke the Saudis. “The Kingdom categorically rejects any interference in its internal affairs, any and all accusations, in any manner, that disrespect its leadership ... and any attempts to undermine its sovereignty or diminish its stature,” a foreign ministry statement said. Khashoggi, a royal insider who became a critic of Prince Mohammed and began writing for the Washington Post after moving to the United States last year, was killed inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in early October. Saudi officials have rejected accusations that the crown prince ordered his death. The murder has sparked global outrage and damaged the international reputation of 33-year-old Prince Mohammed, the kingdom’s de facto leader, who is pushing economic and social changes in the world’s top oil exporter. Saudi Arabia has also come under increased scrutiny for civilian deaths and a humanitarian crisis in Yemen, where it support the internationally-recognized government against Iranian-aligned Houthis in a nearly four-year-old civil war. At U.N.-mediated talks in Sweden last week, the warring parties agreed to a local ceasefire to try to avert more bloodshed in the port of Hodeidah, which is vital for food and aid supplies. Opponents of the Senate resolutions want to maintain the relationship between the United States and Saudi Arabia, which they consider an essential counterweight in the Middle East to Iran. Administration officials also see Saudi support as a linchpin for an Israeli-Palestinian peace plan yet to be disclosed by the Trump administration. And they have argued that ending U.S. support could complicate Yemen peace efforts. The Saudi statement said the kingdom “hopes that it is not drawn into domestic political debates in the United States of America, to avoid any ramifications on the ties between the two countries that could have significant negative impacts on this important strategic relationship.” Reporting by Mohamed El-Sherif, writing by Stephen Kalin, editing by Chris Reese, Larry King",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-saudi-khashoggi-idUSKBN1OF0W3?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=5c171f6704d3011d04584b28&utm_source=inshorts,

St Stephen’s College.St Stephen’s College, the oldest college in Delhi (established in 1881), has a long list of alumni currently in office:And it is not just among these top officers that St Stephen’s is a common theme. Shashi Tharoor – another graduate of St Stephen’s – documented the disproportionate representation of graduates from the college among India’s elite political figures in this 2014 essay for The Hindu.When Tharoor was a student, however, Stephanians were not expected to join politics. In his time, notes Tharoor, graduates of St Stephen’s were expected to go “into the IAS and IFS, not to enter politics.”“They conquered babudom in large numbers every year, rising to the highest ranks of the civil service but believing profoundly that politics was not for them,” adds Tharoor.But that changed as more and more Stephanians became successful politicians, and for Tharoor personally, the turning point was a speech by the then Additional Secretary to the Government of India, Kanwar Natwar Singh.

At one point he waved to the Indian supporters in the crowd, gesturing them to make more noise as the gripping battle between the combatants continued.

I don't like his attitude at the moment,"" Hussey said on Macquarie Sports Radio.Former captain Allan Border remarked on Fox Cricket: ""I don't think I've ever seen any captain carry on like that.""By comparison, Kohli's exchange with Paine was tame and mildly amusing, and the captains again spoke to each other after stumps, swapping thumbs up as they headed to their respective dressing rooms with Australia 4-132 and boasting a 175-run lead.""Tim just asked him where he was going for dinner,"" Nathan Lyon laughed.""I've played enough cricket against Virat to know what he's like.""Virat is Virat.

Alejandro Ramos’ arms and chest ballooned like the legendary cartoon character after a fishing accident off the coast of Pisco in southern Peru.According to a DailyMail report, the 57-year-old was deep sea diving nearly four years ago when a cargo ship cut across his vital oxygen line, which was his only source of compressed air.As a result, the pressure caused extensive and irreparable damage to his chest and arms and added a total of 30 kilos to his frame.Although Ramos managed to swim up to the surface, nitrogen caused damage to his arms.As reported by El Nacional, nitrogen gets compressed and is deposited in fatty tissues when a diver’s body experiences pressure underwater. However, when the diver swims back to the surface, the nitrogen expands back into its gaseous form.Ramos was embarrassed to leave his home before medical experts diagnosed his special condition.He says the bulky frame makes him feel uncomfortable in public and because of lack of funds, he could not get immediate treatment.“I became very depressed, I was close to killing myself. One day I bought rat poison and my son said ""Dad would you like to die like a rat?"", After all, I've been through?,” he told El Nacional.Recently, a specialist doctor in Hyperbaric and underwater medicine told Ramos he does not have any nitrogen bubbles in his fatty tissue and can now undergo serious treatments.“There is a light at the end of the tunnel. Maybe one day I’ll go diving again and see the islands,” said Ramos. ",https://www.timesnownews.com/the-buzz/article/this-man-was-left-with-a-swollen-body-like-popeye-after-a-freak-accident/331747?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,

He remains the world's sixth richest person despite the losses.",Daily Mail,"The founder of Facebook has lost almost a quarter of his net worth after a very bad year for the social media giant. Mark Zuckerberg, the 34-year-old multi-billionaire, is set to be have $15 billion less as the constant bad news surrounding his social media giant took its toll on his fortune, according to Money Magazine.COO Sheryl Sandberg downplaying Russian election interference, user data breaches and fleeing executive talent punished the brand, as well as the man, whose fortune is mostly tied up in ownership of the Facebook platform.Money Magazine drew up a timeline of debacles and stumbles over the course of the year that plunged the billionaire multiple notches down on the list of the wealthiest people on the planet.Mark Zuckerberg, co-founder and CEO of Facebook, testifying before Congress about the Cambridge Analytica use of user data in the 2016 electionBeginning in March, Christopher Wylie, the co-founder of the data analytics firm, Cambridge Analytica, revealed that misappropriated 50 million of Facebook users' data (revised up to 87 million later) and then used that information to target voters in the 2016 election on behalf of the Trump campaign.The Facebook founder temporarily lost  $13 billion on the news which forced him to concede that his company may have made a mistake in not proactively doing something about the breach.'When we heard back from Cambridge Analytica that they had told us that they weren’t using the data and deleted it, we considered it a closed case,' Zuckerberg told Congress when placed on the hotseat. 'In retrospect, that was clearly a mistake.' Mark Zuckerberg's fortune dropped from $75 billion at the start of the year to $57 billion by its endFacebook went from a high this year of $217.50 per share down to a trading price of $144.06 amid the scandals and problems at the social media giantDue to lackluster sales and poorer prospects for growth, investors soured on the platform. Zuckerberg also admitted that spending on security in light of the previous scandal would affect profits. Then came the worst single-day loss in share value in the history of U.S. stocks. Facebook provided its Q2 earnings after trading hours on July 25 while at an all-time high price of $217.50. On July 26, the shares opened 20% lower. Zuckerberg lost $15.9 billion by the end of the day, and another $2.2 billion in following days.With an accelerating fall underway, Money points to an exodus of executive talent from acquired businesses WhatsApp and Instagram painting an unhealthy picture of the internal politics of the company with WhatsApp co-founder tweeting 'It is time. #deletefacebook' as he departed.COO Sheryl Sandberg testifying to the U.S. Senate about foreign operations on social media in September.

""He's a master of the craft and I hope the audience enjoys my period film just as much,"" he added. Johar further revealed many people were shocked when they heard he was doing a period film.",Pinkvilla,"Karan Johar is known for making rom coms and family movies like Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham etc. He also made an impactful movie like My Name Is Khan which is touted as one of his best works. The director's last romantic film titled Ae Dil Hai Mushkil was about unrequited love. A few months ago, KJo surprised the audience by announcing that his next project will be a period drama titled Takht.Karan's movies are usually a visual treat in terms of its exquisiteness and modernness. So, everyone is looking forward to see how he directs a period film for the first time. In an interview with DNA, the director said that just because he is doing a period film, people shouldn't compare him with Sanjay Leela Bhansali. Bhansali's forte is period films where he adds grandeur and royal touch and hence, the question of comparison popped up.The filmmaker told DNA, ""Many people were shocked when they heard I was doing a period film. It doesn’t necessarily mean that they should compare me with Sanjay. He’s a master of the craft and I hope the audience enjoys my period film just as much.""Karan Johar added that as a filmmaker he doesn't want to keep himself away from doing anything in terms of movies.Takht has an ensemble cast of Kareena Kapoor Khan, Ranveer Singh, Alia Bhatt, Anil Kapoor, Vicky Kaushal, Janhvi Kapoor and Bhumi Pednekar.What do you have to say about Karan directing a period film?Can already tell this will be a flop. Karan Johar has a very limited genre. If KJo is smart, he will bring the directors/team of Bahubali on board to save Takht. He doesn't have the skill for this type of cinema.Actually, it feels like KJo has lost his way. He just jumps on the bandwagon for whatever is popular at the time. Right now, a few period films have done well, and he simply thinks he can make one as well. Beware KJo! Thugs was also a period film and failed miserably. Tread carefully when entering unchartered watersThis just shows how we shouldn’t let people get to us. Remember around 2007 during Sawariya and Om Shanti Om clash, FArah and Karan would make fun of Banshali. Now both suck big time, their movies dont make sense, but Banshali makes epic movies back to back.Oh we will. You won’t escape it. Bhansali has set certain standards.Don’t worry. No one will. Bahaha.Absolutely right! SLB has set the benchmark for period films and while I applaud Karan for attempting to make a different kind of film, he should get off his high horse if he thinks that he can outdo SLB.He so wants to outdo SLB as this is one area he hasn’t quite done and wants to show up SLBDon't worry no one thinks you can bedon't worry, we won't because you will never be on his level",https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/news/karan-johar-doing-period-film-takht-doesn-t-necessarily-mean-people-should-compare-me-bhansali-434506?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,

The Victorian screeched in pain and the physiotherapist treated him. Thereafter, he retired hurt and was rushed to a nearby hospital for an X-ray. Nevertheless, Finch has been cleared of any serious damage.AdvertisementMoreover, he is also likely to continue his innings on the fourth day. He also returned to the dressing room with a numb finger late on the third day.

Obviously I was one of those guys who got him, so hopefully it goes okay overnight and he can keep batting tomorrow at some point,” Starc added.After flattering to deceive in the opening Test at Adelaide Oval, Finch made a strong comeback with a gutsy half-century in Perth.

Ruben Garcia, director of the Annunciation House shelter, said the girl’s father, Nery Caal, 29, told him he had no inkling his daughter was ill when they arrived by bus with dozens of other migrants at the U.S. border in Antelope Wells, New Mexico, on the night of Dec. 6. Garcia also said the father agreed with the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) account of the father and daughter’s brief detention, including CBP’s assertion there was no indication that the girl had been suffering from any medical problem until several hours after their arrival. “Jakelin had not been crossing the desert for days,” her family wrote in the English-language statement, which Garcia said was prepared by their attorneys.  “She and her father sought asylum from Border Patrol as soon as they crossed the border,” the statement said. “She had not suffered from a lack of water or food prior to approaching the border.” According to CBP’s account, the girl and her father also had access to water and restrooms during the seven hours they waited to board a CBP bus that would take them early on Dec. 7 from Antelope Wells to another Border Patrol station at Lordsburg, about 95 miles (153 km) away.  The CBP said Nery Caal told agents just before their bus departed that his daughter was vomiting, and by the time they arrived 90 minutes later she had stopped breathing.  She was treated in Lordsburg by emergency personnel, then rushed to an El Paso hospital, where she died the next morning, Dec. 8, after doctors found she was suffering brain swelling and liver failure. Although the father did not contest CBP’s chronology of events, the family’s statement called for “an objective and thorough investigation ... within nationally recognized standards for the arrest and custody of children.” The family did fault CBP for relying on interview forms printed in English, a language the father did not understand. The family’s native tongue is Q’eqchi’, a Mayan dialect, with Spanish being their second language.  The girl’s mother, Claudia Maquin, told Reuters on Saturday in the family’s home village of San Antonio de Cortez in central Guatemala that her spouse and daughter were among thousands of migrants seeking to escape “the extreme poverty that we live in.” The couple have three remaining children. But Jakelin’s grandfather said the 7-year-old and her father had an especially close bond. The El Paso County medical examiner has conducted an autopsy on the girl, but the results will not be made available for up to two weeks, Garcia said. The father was not present for the news conference. Garcia said he was declining to speak to the media for now. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s office of inspector general vowed to conduct an inquiry. Democrats on Capitol Hill want that probe to examine why Congress was not informed of the incident within 24 hours, as they said is required of any death in CBP custody.

The celebrations began in Udaipur with stars like Shah Rukh Khan, Aamir Khan, Salman Khan, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, Abhishek Bachchan and Katrina Kaif burning the dancefloor with their performances. The Sangeet ceremony saw a kickass performance by the one and only, Beyonce, who sizzled and stole the spotlight while leaving everyone in awe. The pre-wedding festivities were followed up by the wedding, which took place on December 12, 2018, in Mumbai. Many Bollywood actors made their presence felt at the wedding which included Big B, SRK, Aamir, Salman, Aishwarya, Abhishek, Saif Ali Khan, Kareena Kapoor Khan, Alia Bhatt, Sonam Kapoor and Janhvi Kapoor amongst others. There were certain pictures from inside the wedding that went viral especially of Big B and Aamir, as they served food to the guests.

Even I would click a pick if AB, Aamir or SRK are serving food to me. No one's gonna click other family members.Abhishek is always free to answer questions on social media!okay..but why was Aamir Khan serving them food?? they are not family LOL
And if they are so close then why did Aamir Khan not take his children to this 'close' wedding. Junaid and Ira are old enough right?When you have money, everybody is your family. Nothing new here.If that's true then why wasn't Priyanka Chopra serving guests?Isha was Priyanka's bridesmaid and Isha invited Priyanka + Nick, Priyanka's mom, Priyanka's best friend + husband to her weddingIf anyone in Bollywood is family to Isha Ambani it's PriyankaAnd Kiara Advan too. Kiara is childhood friends with Isha. Why wasnt Kiara servingDon't be cowards PV. Plz post100% agree. Not buying Abhishek’s explanations.srk and bachchan are far more close the family.Priyanka's just a business partner. Family means connected by blood relations. Mere friendships don't equate to familylGujrathi traditions are different to Punjabi traditions. Also in Punjabi, marriage is called Anand KarajFunny how even Pv is too afraid to post the honest comments!Saajan Kot and not Sajjan Ghot ffsSo they are family?Lol, no. The Ambanis are loaded.we know the tradition he question is why soo much closeness .. they need somethign from them?That makes sense.

""I also come across some of the smart and brightest individuals who had no great formal education and degrees,"" the actor further said.",Times Now,"Mumbai: Actor Emraan Hashmi, who is playing the lead role in the forthcoming film Cheat India, says that the formal education system of India is not good enough for the growth of young minds and believes that such education cannot be a prerequisite for success.Asked what's his opinion on the relevance of formal education, Emraan told IANS here: ""I know some of the stupidest people on earth who had great formal education. I also come across some of the smart and brightest individuals who had no great formal education and degrees. Formal education is not a norm that gets you success in life.""""I think in the present time, the formal education that we are practising in the mainstream, is a waste of time. Just because in a building, a group of people promoting some kind of source for learning, does not mean our students are learning a great thing.""Our education system is still practising something that can only deliver average homegrown clerk that used to happen in the British era. That is not how we can develop young mindsno sorry!"" added the ""Murder"" actor.He believes that in the age of the Internet, universities have moved into online education. Emraan said: ""Without taking the name of any board, I just want to say, the system of our basic education is pretty useless. All we are practising is how to mug up the textbook and write it on the exam paper to get marks and grades. Is that the right way to educate mind?""Emraan, who started his career in 2005, used to be known more for doing on-screen kissing scenes in Bollywood films. He gradually made space for himself in Bollywood with films like Gangster, Aksar, Kalyug, Jannat, The Dirty Picture and Azhar.Is he finally getting his due as an actor? ""Well, earlier I had done films where I was satisfied with the process, the experience of making of the film, but the character I am playing in Cheat India is quite close to my sensibility as an individual,"" Emraan said.""The character is not over the top. It's close to reality and at the same time, engaging. It is bringing an issue to the forefront through the film,"" he said. The film addresses the issue of existing corruption in the field of education. He felt that the film could be a conversation starter on the matter.Was that the sole reason for taking it up? The actor said: ""I would say that is a by-product of a good story. Primarily, when I am listening to a script, it is about how I am reacting to the story as an audience member. If I am becoming part of a narrative, it has to appeal to me first. Cheat India was apt for that.""The story of the film revolves around cheating during examinations, especially in government colleges and in competitive tests where people use power and money to get degrees.Sharing his personal experience, Emraan said: ""I have seen how exam papers are leaked during exams. Some of my friends' friends bought question papers in advance and later they failed in the exam because they got the wrong set of questions. I have seen how students paid money to invigilators to fill the answer papers I never got involved in such activities, but I have seen them happen."" Directed by Soumik Sen, Cheat India is releasing on January 25 next year.

GJ 3470b circles a red dwarf star, whose intense radiation heats hydrogen in the planet's upper atmosphere, causing it to escape into space. ""In only a few billion years, half of the planet may be gone,"" a scientist said.",Times Now,"Washington: Astronomers using the Hubble Space Telescope have discovered a planet roughly the size of Neptune, evaporating at a rate 100 times faster than a previously identified exoplanet of similar size. The findings, published in the journal of Astronomy & Astrophysics, advance astronomers' knowledge about how planets evolve.The speed and distance at which planets orbit their respective blazing stars can determine each planet's fate -- whether the planet remains a longstanding part of its solar system or evaporates into the universe's dark graveyard.""This is the smoking gun that planets can lose a significant fraction of their entire mass,"" said David Sing, a professor at Johns Hopkins University in the US.""GJ 3470b is losing more of its mass than any other planet we have seen so far in only a few billion years from now, half of the planet may be gone,"" Sing said.Planets such as ""super"" Earths and ""hot"" Jupiters orbit more closely to their stars and are therefore hotter, causing the outermost layer of their atmospheres to be blown away. While these larger Jupiter-sized and smaller Earth-sized exoplanets are plentiful, medium Neptune-sized exoplanets -- roughly four times larger than Earth -- are rare.Researchers hypothesise that these Neptunes get stripped of their atmospheres and ultimately become smaller planets. GJ 3470b is 96 light-years away and circles a red dwarf star in the general direction of the constellation Cancer.Hubble found that exoplanet GJ 3470b had lost significantly more mass and had a noticeably smaller exosphere than the first Neptune-sized exoplanet studied, GJ 436b, due to its lower density and receipt of a stronger radiation blast from its host star.GJ 3470b's lower density makes it unable to gravitationally hang on to the heated atmosphere, researchers said. While the star hosting GJ 436b was between 4 billion and 8 billion years old, the star hosting GJ 3470b is only 2 billion years old.A younger star is more active and powerful, and, therefore, has more radiation to heat the planet's atmosphere. The team estimates that GJ 3470b may have already lost up to 35 per cent of its total mass and, in a few billion years, all of its gas may be stripped off, leaving behind only a rocky core.""We're starting to better understand how planets are shaped and what properties influence their overall makeup,"" Sing said.",https://www.timesnownews.com/technology-science/article/hubble-discovers-planet-vanishing-at-record-speed/330910?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,

""They have made inflammatory remarks, they say things that incite people...We know they are funding these terrorist activities,"" he further said.",India.com,"New Delhi: Pakistan Army should make terrorism its enemy as this will lead to internal and external peace, Army chief Gen Bipin Rawat has said. In an interview to a news channel, Gen Rawat said the Indian Army has not put women in combat roles where they can get isolated, where there is a large male population and where contact can take place with an adversary.He said there are women engineers in the Army carrying out mining and de-mining operations, and manning the weapon systems in Air Defence. “We have not put women in frontline combat,” he said.Gen Rawat said it is not as if Army is not ready, but there are practical difficulties and asked if a woman, who is a commanding officer, can be away from duties for six months. “Do I put a restriction on her to say that in during command tenure, you will not be given maternity leave? Can I say that? A ruckus will be created,” he said.Gen Rawat said if Pakistan can show it is not incentivising terror, it will be a step forward. “It is time for them to take steps. Unlike what they say, we should not take two steps. Let’s take a step each. There is terrorist leadership openly making statements about India. They threaten us and say that disunity, terror will be the new normal in India.“Pakistan needs to see what is happening inside their country. Army owns Pakistan and the army has to be in power. For that you need an enemy, or else you’re like the European Union nations. To remain in focus, you need an enemy. They have chosen a wrong enemy. They’ve chosen India. They have been caught out. They should make terrorism the enemy. Then there will be both internal and external peace,” Gen Rawat said.He was asked about the call for improving ties made by Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan. Gen Rawat said Pakistan is inciting Kashmiris and aiding infiltrators but is in constant denial.“They doesn’t respond to repatriation requests. They will not recognise their own, so we are in a confusion regarding who’s the terrorist and who’s an army man from Pakistan,” he said.Answering a query on Pakistan Army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa, Gen Rawat said he keeps taking feedback about him.“They should bring some positives first, then only we can have some conversation. They have made inflammatory remarks, they say things that incite people… This isn’t an environment to work. We know they are funding these terrorist activities,” he said.To a query on China, he said the neigbouring country is validating its concept of theatre commands.“It (theatre commands) is something they are validating but when they are carrying out validation, any adversary should be alert, so we should be alert. We have to watch and keep a check. As of now they are just validating theatre command. They are doing a lot of movement for the western zone theatre of theirs as it faces us. Since both countries have to settle their border issues, both have to remain alert,” he said.Gen Rawat also said that surgical strikes carried out against terror launch pads in Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir in September 2016 were celebrated because these were difficult.“Not recognising the feats of these people is a bad idea. Some recognition with less overhyping is not a bad idea,” he said.Gen Rawat said that the government’s acknowledgement of Army’s operations has also brought the acceptance of the international community.“These operations have gotten the acceptance and now people want more of this. The confidence arises from the successful execution and acceptance of the first operation.”Responding to a query about the Karatpur corridor across the border with Pakistan, he said India has to be very sure of the security concerns.Answering another query, he said that Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has asked them to refer to her as “Raksha Mantri” and not as “madam”.“I think she was quite strong and curt in saying you’ll refer to me as Raksha Mantri, which I think was a good sign because she says don’t look at me as a woman. Because when we say ma’am, we think she’s a woman. I think she’s come as strong as any male counterpart. When she has to make a decision, she does it in a very strong manner,” he said.",https://www.india.com/news/india/pakistan-should-treat-terror-as-its-enemy-for-internal-external-peace-army-chief-bipin-rawat-3481257/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,

This comes after the government filed an affidavit with SC seeking factual corrections in the verdict.",Times Now,"New Delhi: The Supreme Court verdict on Rafale fighter jet deal is based on 'factual-bloomers,' former Union Minister and senior Congress leader Kapil Sibal said on Saturday. He also slammed Prime Minister Narendra Modi led NDA's Central government, stating that ""Centre has submitted wrong facts to the apex court and Attorney General should be held responsible for it.""The apex court on Friday dismissed all the petitions seeking probe into the Rafale deal stating that it was ""satisfied"" with the Central government's decision-making process.Addressing a press conference, Sibal said that the Attorney General should be called before the Public Accounts Committee (PAC). ""Government is responsible for giving wrong facts to the Supreme Court. I think the Attorney General should be called before the PAC to and get these issues clarified.""""Why they made these assertions before the court through an affidavit and why such affidavit was filed which didn't reflect true facts? The facts filed in the affidavit by the government are factual-bloomers for which government is responsible not the court. Attorney General must be asked why the wrong facts were presented in the court. This is a very serious matter,"" he stated.Sibal further said that the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court under Article 32 is limited and, therefore, the court really can't give any findings on these issues. ""The court cannot decide on the pricing, technical capabilities of the aircraft,"" he added.Highlighting the concerns raised by the Congress over Rafale deal, Sibal said: ""We (Congress) have been very clear that the Supreme Court was not an appropriate forum on which these issues can be decided, as it cannot summon and examine file notings, witnesses on oath, including questioning the Prime Minister and the Defence Minister.""Pointing to the apex court not arbitrating on matters of pricing or the technical aspects of the Rafale deal, Sibal criticised the NDA government for claiming the verdict as a clean chit. ""It is childish that the BJP is claiming victory in the case,"" he added.""They cannot say that allegations made by the Congress were baseless. In the 2G scam, they put allegations on us and the apex court declared that they were fiction. But this time, we will prove that our allegations are not fiction, but merely a truth,"" Sibal added.Responding to the protest launched by the BJP seeking an apology from the Congress, Sibal said, ""As far as Home Minister Rajnath Singh is concerned, not the Congress, but Rajnath Singh, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley and Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman should apologise for their contentions that the Congress had put the nation's security at stake by politicising the defence deal.""Continuing his attack against the Centre, Sibal said: ""The Supreme Court has made it clear that the issue of pricing of matters relating to technical suitability of the equipment would not be gone into by the court. Then how can the government claim that the apex court has stated that there was no corruption in the deal.""Elaborating about the combine report of CAG and PAC on the deal, Sibal said, ""Para 25 of the court's judgment refers to CAG report having been examined by PAC states that CAG report is in the public domain. Kharge is the chairman of PAC. He hasn't got any report. Then on what evidence such facts were presented before the court.""Sibal also said that the court's verdict was an embarrassment for the judicial body itself. ""It is an embarrassment for the court that they have to give a decision based on factual errors. The court has to put this in their judgement and it is against the public record.

He then removed her underwear and began to perform oral sex, as she started to sob in protest. He then asked, ""Do you even want to be an actress?""Weinstein also bragged about allegedly sleeping with Jennifer Lawrence and said that he was trying to help her and that he was the gateway to her dreams, according to the suit.

The pacer after bagging important scalps in the first Test followed up with good performance in the second game as well. In the first innings, with the figures of 4/41, he registered his best bowling numbers down under. His spell helped the Indian team to wrap the Aussie tail quickly without much of a damage towards the end.However, despite the good performance, the Australian media has been after him. Apparently, as per Fox Cricket, Ishant bowled six consecutive no-balls in an over. But, all of these went unnoticed by the on-field umpire. Both him as well as the umpire have been severely criticised ever since in the Australian media. This poor policing of where his front-foot lands attracted the ire of the host nation.AdvertisementFollowing the second day’s play, Ishant was the man who turned up to attend the press conference from the Indian camp.

""They (Congress) have looted the defence sector...All they see is a way to make money even if it means the morale of our forces is diminished,"" he added.",Times Now,"Chennai: Prime Minister Narendra Modi Saturday launched a blistering attack on the Congress party, saying national security and defence sector were either a punching bag or a funding source for it. Modi's attack on the opposition party came even as the Congress accused the government of ""misleading"" the Supreme court by presenting wrong information about the CAG report on the Rafale deal and demanded that the government apologise for it.The Congress has also said the Supreme Court, which gave the government relief in the Rafale jet case, has not gone into the pricing and technical aspects of the aircraft and it is only a joint parliamentary committee that can probe whether there was any irregularity in the deal. Targeting the main opposition party in an interaction with BJP workers from Tamil Nadu through video conference from New Delhi, Modi alleged that the (Congress) leaders call the army chief names and mock at the (2016) surgical strike on the one hand.""On the other hand, they have looted the defence sector from the jeep scam back in the 1940s and 50s to Bofors in the 80s, the AgustaWestland and submarine scam, among many others,"" he said. ""All they see is the way to make money even if it means the morale of our forces is diminished.Sadly, for the Congress, national security and the defence sector are either a punching bag or a funding source,"" he said. Modi said the country was proud of the forces and have faith in them and the government has ensured operational freedom for them to deal with ""those who are our harming the country.""""The surgical strikes show how capable our forces are to give a strong answer to those who attack us,"" he said. During an election campaign in Rajasthan recently, Modi had slammed Congress president Rahul Gandhi for ""raising doubts"" over the cross-border surgical strike carried out by the Army in September 2016.The prime minister Saturday also said it was the BJP-led NDA government that fulfilled the long-pending demand for One Rank One Pension for armed forces and veterans that was lying unattended for 40 years. Apparently referring to the previous UPA government, Modi alleged that after much persuasion, it left a mere Rs 500 crore aside for the OROP ""which was nothing short of a cruel joke.""""When we got the opportunity to implement the OROP, we did it with full sincerity,"" he said. As part of his nation-wide dialogue with BJP workers in the run-up to the Lok Sabha elections, Modi said ""ours is a government that values your safety and well-being above everything. We will do everything possible to protect India and the 130 crore Indians.""""We are a peace-loving nation but will not hesitate to give a fitting reply to anti-social elements who harm our people and disturb our development,"" he said. The prime minister said when it comes to national security, the morale of the forces was important. ""Among the first things that the government did after coming to power was that we have conveyed to the soldiers that we value them. The soldier who is standing at the border knows that the country is standing behind him,"" he said.The Maoist terror, which had once affected many districts, was on the decline and there has been a major crackdown against Maoists and their sympathisers, Modi said. ""Forty-four districts, which were earlier affected by Left-wing terrorism, show zero incidences of violence in the last four years,"" he said.""It has happened because, on the one hand, there has been sustained campaign by the security forces to fight back, while on the other, the government is making efforts to develop these regions,"" Modi said. ""In Kashmir, while we have reached out to the people in full measure, the army has struck a heavy blow to terror and eliminated terrorists in record numbers,"" he pointed out.Recently, panchayat polls were held peacefully which show great participation (of people), he said. ""Striking terrorists where it hurts them the most has become a new normal in India's anti-terror policy,"" he said. As part of enhancing the country's security, Modi said, India's pride, nuclear submarine INS Arihant successfully completed its first deterrence patrol on November 5.""The success of INS Arihant enhances India's security needs and it is a major achievement for our entire nation and with INS Arihant, India's nuclear triad is complete,"" the prime minister said.""True to its name, INS Arihant will protect Indians from external threats and contribute to the atmosphere of peace in the region..will ensure peace,"" he added. ",https://www.timesnownews.com/india/article/rafale-row-pm-narendra-modi-launches-attack-on-congress-says-national-security-is-punching-bag-for-congress/331612?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,

LVMH, the firm behind fashion labels Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior, already owns the Bvlgari and Cheval Blanc hotel chains. Belmond owns hotels, high-end river cruises and train services across 24 countries.",Reuters,"PARIS (Reuters) - Luxury goods maker LVMH (LVMH.PA) has agreed to buy Belmond BEL.N, the owner of hotels including Venice’s landmark Cipriani, for a total of $3.2 billion to raise its profile in upmarket hospitality.  LVMH, the firm behind fashion labels Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior, already has hotels including the Cheval Blanc in the prestigious Courchevel ski resort in the French Alps, as well as Bvlgari hotels. The Belmond deal is LVMH’s largest since it spent 4.3 billion euros in 2011 to buy Bvlgari and 6.5 billion euros in 2017 to gain full control of Christian Dior. It will have a limited impact of its debt and boost 2018 earnings per share, before synergies by just 0.1 percent. LVMH will “reach critical mass in the ultimate luxury hotel world with one single acquisition,” finance chief Jean-Jacques Guiony told analysts during a call. “The priority is to develop and improve the profitability of these exceptional brands and nurture complementarity with the LVMH group brands,” he added The acquisition will give it properties including the only hotel within the Machu Picchu citadel in southern Peru, Hotel Splendido in Portofino on the Italian riviera and the Copacabana Palace in Rio de Janeiro, moving LVMH further into the fast-growing “experiential” high-end travel and hospitality sector. The transaction follows a wave of deals in the luxury hotels sector, including AccorHotels’ (ACCP.PA) purchase of FRHI Holdings, the parent of the Fairmont and Raffles hotels. “While some investors may question the acquisition, which appears to lie outside LVMH group’s core operations, we believe it is consistent with its long-term strategy focused on offering the consumer a full spectrum of luxury experience,” Berenberg analysts said in a research note.  Guiony said the deal reflected LVMH’s belief that “the future of luxury is in luxury goods and in luxury experiences”. It also pushes LVMH further into new luxury services at a time of growing concern that Chinese demand for high-end fashion and handbags will start waning amid worries about the health of the world’s second-largest economy and potential damage from Washington’s protracted trade spat with Beijing. LVMH said it would pay $25 per Belmond share, a 40 percent premium to Thursday’s closing price.   The deal, expected to close in the first half of 2019, values Belmond’s equity at $2.6 billion, and the group, including debt, at $3.2 billion. Belmond posted earnings of $140 million before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) on revenue of $572 million in the 12 months to Sept. 30. Half of revenue comes from Europe and 20 percent from North America.  At 1520 GMT, LVMH shares were down 0.9 percent at 253.45 euros in a weak European stock market .FTEU3 while Belmond shares jumped 40 percent in New York to $24.74.  RBC Capital Markets analysts said the price of the deal - at 5.6 times recent sales and 22.9 times recent EBITDA - looked “optically high”, but added: “Belmond owns a unique portfolio of trophy real estate assets, that will allow LVMH to increase its exposure to experiential luxury”. LVMH ended up paying a multiple of 19 times Belmond’s expected EBITDA for next year, according to Refinitiv data. Bigger hotel chains like Hilton and Marriott International (MAR.O) trade on forward multiples of just over 12 times.  Belmond owns, partly owns or manages 46 luxury hotels, restaurants and train and river-cruise properties located in exotic and distinctive destinations worldwide.

38031,UEFA fines AC Milan $13 million for breaking fair play rules,Italy's AC Milan was fined $13.6 million by UEFA on Friday and threatened with a one-season ban from European competition for breaking financial fair play rules. UEFA said its club finance panel ruled the ban will be activated if AC Milan fails to break even on football-related business in June 2021. The club was recently eliminated from the Europa League.,The New Indian Express,"NYON (SWITZERLAND): AC Milan was fined 12 million euros ($13.6 million) by UEFA on Friday and threatened with a one-season ban from European competition for breaking financial fair play rules.UEFA said its club finance panel ruled the ban will be activated if AC Milan fails to break even on football-related business in June 2021. If Milan fails to comply, it will be banned for the next UEFA competition it qualifies for in either of the 2022-23 or 2023-24 seasons.The decision was announced the day after Milan was eliminated from the Europa League in the group stage. The 12 million euros ($13.6 million) will be deducted from its prize money.The fine is one of the biggest imposed by UEFA since financial fair play sanctions began in 2014. Then, Manchester City and Paris Saint-Germain had 20 million euros ($22.6 million) withheld from their Champions League prize money.UEFA originally banned Milan from the Europa League in June for violations of rules monitoring spending on player transfers and wages up to 2017. The club also spent heavily in an offseason spending spree that year.Milan was reinstated within weeks by the Court of Arbitration for Sport, which sent the case back to UEFA for a fairer punishment.The court said an immediate ban had been too harsh given the club's new business plan after a takeover by US -based hedge fund Elliott Management.Elliott took control of Milan in June after former owner Li Yonghong missed a deadline to repay part of a loan worth more than 300 million euros ($350 million) from the hedge fund. Elliott repossessed the holding company in Luxembourg that Li used to buy Milan.For 2017-18, Milan spent more than 200 million euros (then nearly $250 million) on new players. That was despite questions over the financial stability of the Chinese-led consortium that paid $800 million to buy the club from former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi in April 2017.Milan's finances could improve by playing in the Champions League for the first time since the 2013-14 season. The team is currently fourth in Serie A, which would qualify for next season's competition and prize money of at least $50 million.However, a further UEFA punishment Friday was limiting Milan to 21 senior players — instead of 25 — in its squad for the next two seasons of Champions League or Europa League football.Milan can appeal the punishments to CAS.",http://www.newindianexpress.com/sport/football/2018/dec/15/uefa-fines-ac-milan-usd-13-million-by-uefa-for-breaking-fair-play-rules-threatens-european-ban-1911720.html?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,

Identified as 35-year-old Sidhant Verma, the accused is a former jeweller-turned robber who has a criminal track record with alleged involvement in as many as 30 cases.According to Delhi police, the incident took place on Monday when Verma was driving his i20 car near Mayur Vihar Phase-1. The accused's car brushed past Kumar outside a store in Acharya Niketan, said an official familiar with the matter adding that Kumar broke the front window of Verma's car in a fit of rage. The argument led to Verma shooting Kumar four times with his gun before fleeing the scene of the crime.Eyewitnesses said that Verma kept telling the victim that the number of criminal cases against him was more than the victim's age.
With the help of CCTV footage retrieved from a 24Seven store where the incident happened, police identified the accused and launched a search operation for him. In an attempt to evade arrest, Verma cut his hair short and even shaved off his beard and moustache. Fortunately, a tip off on Thursday led the police to believe that Verma would visit his wife and children at a rented apartment in Ghaziabad. Acting on the intel, officials managed to catch Verma near the Dasna Toll Plaza. In fact, police recovered the murder weapon he used to kill Kumar from Verma's possession.Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP), East, Pankaj Singh said that the accused was using reversible number plates to escape the clutches of law enforcement. During interrogation, Verma told police officials how the loss he faced in his ancestral jewellery business led him to a life of crime.

The recently concluded assembly election in five states, agriculture loan waiver and increasing minimum support price (MSP) of cereals was again part of manifesto of some of the political parties.""I have said forever, even written a letter to the Election Commissioner saying they should be taken off the table.

But Mashrafe's die-hard attitude off the pitch -- he has had seven operations on his knee -- and on-field expressions of patriotism could well endear him to voters. He also won plaudits as captain, guiding the cricket minnows to their first World Cup quarter-final in 2015.- 'Gutter-like' -
Still, when Mashrafe announced his decision to enter politics, many fans were openly critical. Most of the comments on his social media fan pages are against him joining Bangladesh's ""nasty"" and ""gutter-like"" political arena.Others criticised him for joining the party of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who has been accused of jailing opponents and stifling dissent. But Mashrafe insists that he will not be dragged down.""All I can say from my position is the people who are in a different party or believe in a different political belief, I don't have any disrespect for them,"" he said.""Even though I'm supporting my party wholeheartedly, I have 100 percent respect for them and will continue to have it. ""I'm saying this because every person has the right to support who they want to support. I can only respect the opposition from my heart, which I really do.""He also set the bar high for politicians.""Politicians should be qualified and good human beings. I'm not saying I'm already one of them though. The young people are closely seeing our social decadence. I think they should also step into politics,"" he said.   ",https://www.timesnownews.com/sports/cricket/article/bangladesh-mashrafe-mortaza-harbours-no-imran-khan-like-ambitions/331487?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,
38058,Google launches AI tool to screen for diabetic eye disease,"Google has launched an AI-based program in Thailand to help screen for diabetic retinopathy, which can cause permanent blindness. The program, which has an accuracy rate of 95%, analyses eye screen results to assess if patients are at a risk of vision loss. Google said its life sciences division Verily is working on launching the program in India too.",Reuters,"BANGKOK (Reuters) - Google said on Thursday it had launched an artificial intelligence program in Thailand to screen for a diabetic eye disease which causes permanent blindness. The eye screening program in Thailand follows a similar Google program in India and highlights a push by big tech companies to show the social benefits of new AI technologies.     “As a society, we have a responsibility to use AI in the best possible way,” Kent Walker, the company’s Senior Vice President for Global Affairs, said in speech at a Google event in Bangkok on Thursday.  The event also highlighted other social benefits of Google’s AI projects, such as stopping illegal fishing in Indonesia.  Google’s Thailand diabetes program was announced in partnership with a Thai state-run Rajavithi Hospital. This followed a joint-study which found the AI program to have an accuracy rate of 95 percent when it comes to disease detection, compared with 74 percent from opticians or eye doctors.  The program analyses patients’ eye screen results to assess if they are at a risk of vision loss, which will enable them to have preemptive treatment.  Thailand is one of the world’s most important sugar producers and high sugar consumption is common amongst its 69 million population. The Thai government has been campaigning against behavior that can lead to diabetes and has made the diabetic eye screening one of the country’s national health indicators since 2015.   Thailand has only around 1,400 eye doctors for its 5 million diabetic patients, who are all at risk of the vision loss, Paisan Ruamviboonsuk, Ravajithi Hospital’s assistant director, told reporters.  Paisan said the program is intended to achieve a nationwide eye screening rate of 60 percent, which is also the Thai government’s target.  In October, Google said it would grant about $25 million globally next year to humanitarian and environmental projects seeking to use AI for good.

38074,Boeing opens first 737 plant in China amid US-China trade war,"US-based planemaker Boeing on Saturday opened its first 737 completion and delivery centre in China amid the ongoing US-China trade war. ""Am I nervous about the situation? Yeah, of course. It's a challenging environment,"" Boeing China President John Bruns said. The completion centre, which installs interiors and paints liveries, was inaugurated after more than a year of construction.",Reuters,"ZHOUSHAN, China (Reuters) - Boeing Co opened its first 737 completion plant in China on Saturday, a strategic investment aimed at building a sales lead over arch-rival Airbus in one of the world’s top travel markets that has been overshadowed by the U.S-China trade war. The world’s largest planemaker was also poised to deliver the first of its top-selling 737s completed at the facility in Zhoushan, about 290 km (180 miles) southeast of Shanghai, to state carrier Air China during a ceremony on Saturday with top executives from both companies. Boeing and Airbus have been expanding their footprint in China as they vie for orders in the fast-growing aviation market, which is expected to overtake the United States as the world’s largest in the next decade.  Boeing invested $33 million last year to take a majority stake in a joint venture with state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corp of China (COMAC) to build the completion centre, which installs interiors and paints liveries.  Chicago-based Boeing calls itself the top U.S. exporter and delivered more than one out of every four jetliners it made last year to customers in China, where it forecasts demand for 7,700 new airplanes over the next 20 years valued at $1.2 trillion. However, the plant’s inaugural ceremony was overshadowed by tensions between the United States and China as they engage in a bruising tit-for-tat tariff war. The world’s two largest economies are in a 90-day detente to negotiate a trade deal.  “Am I nervous about the situation? Yeah, of course. It’s a challenging environment,” John Bruns, President of Boeing China, told reporters on a conference call earlier on Saturday. “We have to keep our eye on the long game in China. Long term, I’m optimistic we will work our way through this,” he said.  While the trade frictions have hurt businesses such as U.S. soy bean farmers and Chinese manufacturers, their impact on Boeing has been unclear. U.S.-made aircraft have so far escaped Beijing’s tariffs. Bruns said he remained optimistic about the outcome of trade talks between the United States and China and described aviation as a “bright spot” amid tensions between the two countries.  Asked about the possibility of technology transfer agreements between Boeing and COMAC, Bruns stressed that the purpose of the plant was for installing seats, painting vehicles, and completing the planes’ final delivery.  “That’s only a part of what we do in the production of airplanes,” he said. Boeing aims eventually to hit a delivery target of 100 planes a year at Zhoushan, although Bruns deflected a question on how quickly it would reach that level and said Boeing had no plans to expand work to other aircraft types. Boeing also hopes the plant will relieve pressure at the Seattle-area facility where it plans to boost production next year of its best-selling 737 narrowbody aircraft but has struggled with production delays.

The film will be screened thrice during the festival being held from January 3-14, 2019. The film is under the competition category - New Voices New Vision.The movie, which marks Vikas' debut as a director and screenwriter, is based on his bestselling book by the same name.

He was shooting for Holi for his book Utsav: A Culinary Epic of Indian Festivals in Vrindavan when he witnessed a desolate sight - everyone was playing with colours during the festival except for the widows who were dressed in white and watching the celebrations from their balconies and terraces.However, in 2013, the Supreme Court of India allowed the widows in Vrindavan to get rehabilitated and live a life of dignity which included being able to participate in festivals such as Holi. This coupled with Vikas' experience of meeting a nine-year-old flower seller girl inspired him to tell this compelling story.""This is a story that had to be told and I am glad that I am finally getting an opportunity to do so. This story not only moved me deeply but also motivated me to pen it into a book and subsequently make it into a film,"" Vikas said in a statement.""From writing the book to making the film, the journey of The Last Color has been a long and eventful one.

Denouncing the legislation as “racist,” Jerusalem-born Portman called it a political decision that has an impact on many people’s lives.In an interview marking the release of her new film ‘Vox Lux’, she also said she hopes “that we will really love our neighbors and work together.”This is not the first time the Hollywood diva has expressed anger over the controversial legislation. Earlier this month, she told BBC Arabic that the law is “wrong” and she disagrees with it. “It’s racist and there’s nothing else to say about that.” In July, the Israeli Parliament approved the ‘nation-state bill’, which enshrines Israel as the Jewish homeland, downgrades the status of Arabic, and limits the right to self-determination to Jews.READ MORE: 'Resist apartheid!'

In April, the actress refused to attend the Genesis Prize ceremony, often called the ‘Jewish Nobel’, which is given annually to Jewish people who have gained recognition in their fields.Portman said she “does not feel comfortable participating in any public events in Israel” because of the “extremely distressing” recent events and added that she “cannot in good conscience move forward with the ceremony.” The ‘Great March of Return’ marches which started this spring at the Gaza border saw many Palestinians killed and injured.READ MORE: Israel passes Jewish-only 'national self-determination' law despite outcryShe was accused of supporting the BDS (Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions) movement, but claimed she was only against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s policies.Israeli MP Oren Hazan said that “from the outset, the idea of granting the Genesis Prize to Natalie Portman was complete craziness,” because she “on the one hand cynically uses her birthplace to advance her career and on the other is proud of the fact that she managed to avoid enlisting in the IDF.

The technology needs considerations ""to ensure its use...avoids abuse and harmful outcomes,"" Google Senior VP of Global Affairs Kent Walker said. ""It's up to all of us to ensure that AI is developed responsibly,"" he added.",TechCrunch,"In recent months, pressure has been mounting for major tech firms to develop strong policies regarding facial recognition. Microsoft has helped lead the way on that front, promising to put in place stricter policies, calling for greater regulation and asking fellow companies to follow suit. Hidden toward the end of a blog post about using artificial intelligence to benefit health clinics in Asia, Google SVP Kent Walker affirmed the company’s commitment not to sell facial recognition APIs. The executive cites concerns over how the technology could be abused. “[F]acial recognition technology has benefits in areas like new assistive technologies and tools to help find missing persons, with more promising applications on the horizon,” Walker writes. “However, like many technologies with multiple uses, facial recognition merits careful consideration to ensure its use is aligned with our principles and values, and avoids abuse and harmful outcomes. We continue to work with many organizations to identify and address these challenges, and unlike some other companies, Google Cloud has chosen not to offer general-purpose facial recognition APIs before working through important technology and policy questions.”In an interview this week, CEO Sundar Pichai addressed similar growing concerns around AI ethics. “I think tech has to realize it just can’t build it and then fix it,” he told The Washington Post. “I think that doesn’t work,” adding that artificial intelligence could ultimately prove “far more dangerous than nukes.”The ACLU, which has offered sharp criticism over privacy and racial profiling concerns, lauded the statement. In the next paragraph, however, the company promised to continue to apply pressure on these large orgs. “We will continue to put Google’s feet to the fire to make sure it doesn’t build or sell a face surveillance product that violates civil and human rights,” ACLU tech director Nicole Ozer said in a statement. “We also renew our call on Amazon and Microsoft to not provide dangerous face surveillance to the government. Companies have a responsibility to make sure their products can’t be used to attack communities and harm civil rights and liberties — it’s past time all companies own up to that responsibility.”The organization has offered particularly sharp criticism against Amazon for its Rekognition software. This week, it also called out the company’s patent application for a smart doorbell that uses facial recognition to identify “suspicious” visitors.",https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/14/google-agrees-not-to-sell-facial-recognition-tech-citing-abuse-potential/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,

38111,Swiss team builds drone that can fold to pass through gaps,"Zurich University and EPFL engineers have developed a drone that can shrink itself to fit through narrow gaps. ""The goal... is to develop drones which can be used in the aftermath of a disaster, as for example an earthquake,"" a researcher said. The design was inspired by birds, which can fold their wings mid-flight, the scientists revealed.",TechCrunch,"Researchers at the University of Zurich  and EPFL have created a robot that shrinks to fit through gaps, a feature that could make it perfect for search and rescue missions. The researchers initially created a drone that could assess man-made gaps and squeeze through in seconds using only one camera. This extra feature — a scissor-like system to shrink the drone in flight — makes it even more versatile and allows these drones to react to larger or smaller gaps in nature.“The idea came up after we worked on quadrotor flight through narrow gaps,” said PhD candidate Davide Falanga. “The goal of our lab is to develop drones which can be in the future used in the aftermath of a disaster, as for example an earthquake, in order to enter building through small cracks or apertures in a collapsed building to look for survivors. Our previous approach required a very aggressive maneuver, therefore we looked into alternative solutions to accomplish a task as passing through a very narrow gap without having to fly at high speed. The solution we came up with is the foldable drone, a quadrotor which can change its shape to adapt to the task.”The system measures the gap and changes its shape without outside processing, a feat that is quite exciting. All of the processing is done on board and it could be turned into an autonomous system if necessary. The team built the drone with off the shelf and 3D-printed parts.“The main difference between conventional drones and our foldable drone is in the way the arms are connected to the body: each arm is connected through a servo motor, which can change the relative position between the main body and the arm. This allows the robot to literally fold the arms around the body, which means that potentially any morphology can be obtained. An adaptive controller is aware of the drone’s morphology and adapts to it in order to guarantee stable flight at all times, independently of the configuration,” said Falanga.The team published a report on their findings in Robotics and Automation Letters. As IEEE notes, this is no flying drone dragon, but it is a far simpler, cooler and more effective product.",https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/14/this-drone-shrinks-to-fit/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,

The Nigerian military said that it urged ""UNICEF representatives to ensure they share information with relevant authorities whenever induction or training of new staff is being conducted"".",Reuters,"MAIDUGURI, Nigeria (Reuters) - The Nigerian military on Friday lifted a suspension of United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund activities in the northeast of the country, hours after it was imposed amid accusations that UNICEF staff spied for Islamist militants in the restive region. Nigeria’s northeast has been torn apart by a decade-long insurgency by Boko Haram and its splinter group Islamic State West Africa, in which more than 30,000 people have been killed and many more driven from their homes. With millions displaced, the northeast is largely dependent on international aid. Earlier on Friday, the Nigerian military said UNICEF had been training people to sabotage troops’ counter-insurgency efforts by uncovering alleged human rights abuses by the military. In its statement, the Nigerian military said UNICEF staff “train and deploy spies who support the insurgents and their sympathizers”. These were “unwholesome practices that could further jeopardize the fight against terrorism and insurgency”, it said, adding that UNICEF’s operations were being suspended in the northeast until further notice. But in a second statement hours later, the military said it  held an emergency meeting with UNICEF representatives late on Friday.  “After extensive deliberations on the need to seek modalities to work harmoniously with the security agencies in the theater of operation, the Theatre Command has henceforth lifted the three months suspension earlier imposed on UNICEF,” the military said in its second statement.  In its second statement, the military said during the meeting it urged “UNICEF representatives to ensure they share information with relevant authorities whenever induction or training of new staff is being conducted in the theater”. Earlier, after the allegation and suspension, a UNICEF spokeswoman said the organization was “verifying the information”. In April, Nigeria’s military declared three UNICEF employees “persona non grata”, in connection with alleged leaks of information about soldiers sexually abusing children in the northeast, people familiar with the matter told Reuters. The declaration was rescinded days later after pressure from diplomats, the sources said. Nigeria’s military is highly sensitive to allegations of human rights abuses.

But all around her are plastic bags, floating around in the water body. This stunning photograph with Kannada actor Rashmika Mandanna has caught the attention of people on social media. The photo is part of a photoshoot that the actor did, to raise awareness about water pollution in our lakes, particularly Bellandur. While Rashmika didn’t actually enter the lake for the photos (that would be quite a health risk!), the striking photos are getting people talking about the issue.Speaking with TNM, Rashmika said, “It all started when a senior from school spoke to me about this project. She told me this is not a paid thing, but since this was to raise awareness about pollution, I was interested.” Four photographs featuring Rashmika was released by the actor on Thursday on social media and they went viral by Friday – two in which she is on the lake bed, one where she is swimming in a water body, and one where she is suspended under water.The inside water and underwater photos were taken at a friend’s pool, and the photos were later edited to make them dramatic. The other two photos were shot on the banks of Bellandur lake.“It was the first time I had gone to that part of the city,” Rashmika says about her visit to Bellandur, “and as soon as I saw the crowd of people living there, I was heartbroken. I did not feel like leaving my car and I thought, how could people breathe this air. There was so much foam and it was flying around everywhere.”“It’s high time we start talking about pollution and working on this issue,” she said, “We wanted to do the underwater shoot to showcase how grave the situation is and how bad things are going to be if we don’t change.”Well wasn't aware of this till we had to actually go and shoot this in Bellandur lake..which like really broke my heart,and imagine few years down the line..it’s the same case everywhere else..

However, he said the country will not move its embassy to West Jerusalem immediately. Israel regards all of Jerusalem as its capital, including the eastern sector that it annexed after the 1967 Middle East war.",Reuters,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia formally recognizes west Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, reversing decades of Middle East policy, but will not move its embassy there immediately, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Saturday. Israel described the move as a step in the right direction.      Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat said the announcement was born of Australian “petty domestic politics.”  “Australia now recognizes west Jerusalem, being the seat of the Knesset and many of the institutions of government, is the capital of Israel,” Morrison said. “We look forward to moving our embassy to west Jerusalem when practical,” he told reporters in Sydney.   Morrison also confirmed Australia’s support for a two-state solution with a Palestinian capital in East Jerusalem. In October, Morrison said he was open to shifting Australia’s embassy from Tel Aviv. President Donald Trump’s move of the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv in May delighted Israel, infuriated Palestinians and upset the wider Arab world and Western allies. Morrison’s unexpected announcement in October was viewed cynically at the time because it came days before a crucial by-election in an electorate with a strong Jewish representation, a poll his party subsequently lost. It also drew criticism from Muslim-majority neighbors such as Indonesia and Malaysia, neither of whom formally recognize Israel’s right to exist. Arab countries worried that the move would unnecessarily inflame tensions in the Middle East. Morrison said Australia would not move its embassy to west Jerusalem until the city’s final status was determined, but said trade and defense offices would be opened there. “Israel views the decision of the Australian government to open its Trade and Defence office in Jerusalem as a step in the right direction,” the Israeli Foreign Ministry said in a statement. The Palestinians’ Erekat said the move stemmed from “petty domestic politics.”  “The policies of this Australian administration have done nothing to advance the two-state solution,” Erekat said in a statement. “All of Jerusalem remains a final status issue for negotiations, while East Jerusalem, under international law, is an integral part of the occupied Palestinian territory.” The Arab League’s Assistant Secretary General for Palestine and the Occupied Arab Territories, Saeed Abu Ali, condemned Australia’s decision as a break with the international community’s positions that disregards international law. In a statement, he said it was “blatantly biased toward the positions and policies of the Israeli occupation.” Indonesia’s foreign ministry spokesman, Arrmanatha Nasir, noted that Australia had not moved its embassy to Jerusalem and called on all members of the United Nations to recognize a Palestinian state “based on the principle of two-state solutions”. The status of Jerusalem, home to sites holy to the Muslim, Jewish and Christian faiths, is one of the biggest obstacles to a peace agreement between Israel and Palestinians who want East Jerusalem recognized as the capital of a Palestinian state. Israel regards all of Jerusalem as its capital, including the eastern sector that it annexed in a move not recognized internationally, after the 1967 Middle East war.

38153,"Who's Angela Ponce, 1st transgender contestant at Miss Universe?",Spain's Angela Ponce is the first transgender contestant in Miss Universe's 66-year history. She started working as a model at the age of 18 and is also the first transgender woman to win the title of Miss Universe Spain. Ponce currently works as a volunteer at a foundation in Spain that helps children and families deal with gender identity issues.,Reuters,"BANGKOK (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Like many other contestants at the Miss Universe beauty pageant, Angela Ponce grew up watching the glitzy spectacle on television, dreaming of representing her country one day. This year, her wish has come true, with Ponce making history as the first transgender contestant in the pageant’s 66-year history. “Trans women have been persecuted and erased for so long. I’m showing that trans women can be whatever they want,” said Ponce, who was crowned Miss Spain earlier this year. “I am proud to have the opportunity to use this platform for a message of inclusion, tolerance and respect for the LGBT+ community,” she said in an interview in Bangkok, where the finale is to be held on Dec. 17. The Miss Universe Organization, which owns the beauty pageant, lifted a ban on transgender contestants in 2012. The competition airs in more than 190 countries, with an estimated half a billion viewers annually. Picked by several online bookies as the favorite to win the crown, Ponce volunteers with a non-profit in Spain that works with children and families dealing with gender identity issues. Transgender children often struggle with depression and suicidal thoughts, she said. “I was born into a world, into a society which really wasn’t prepared for me. I had the support of my family, but I still faced discrimination, and I had no role models,” she said.  “So many children face discrimination for being different. It is important to tell them they have a right to be who they are, who they want to be,” she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation through an interpreter. The pageant will take place as Thailand prepares to pass a landmark bill that would allow civil partnerships of same-sex couples, becoming the first Asian country to do so. Taiwan’s constitutional court last year ruled that same-sex couples had the right to legally marry, and set a two-year deadline for legalization. But voters last month rejected a referendum on legalization.     Ponce, 26, said she was shut out of several fashion competitions because she is transgender. “When I won Miss Spain, I was so excited,” she said. “As they were placing the crown, I just shut my eyes to take it in, because I knew it was a very significant moment.” Also significantly, the pageant this year features its first all-woman selection panel, said a spokeswoman for Miss Universe Organization. Among the 94 contestants is another woman who has battled prejudice, and is also making history as Panama’s first indigenous Miss Universe contestant. “When I entered the competition, there was a lot of criticism; people attacked me on Instagram and in the media, and said I should not be allowed to compete,” said Rosa Montezuma, her eyes welling up. There are an estimated 370 million indigenous people in the world, according to the United Nations.  They make up less than 5 percent of the global population, but account for 15 percent of the poorest as they are denied land rights, and access to education and healthcare. “Indigenous people have a lot of traditional knowledge, but we are not given the same opportunities,” said Montezuma, 25.  “This is a great platform for me to reach the whole world and show that indigenous girls can also be successful.” Reporting by Rina Chandran @rinachandran; Editing by Jared Ferrie.

Instead of sending a message to the people of Delhi that the government cares about their safety and security and organising programmes to remember the brave girl, they are celebrating,” said ex-MLA Anil Kumar Chaudhary.Singer Sona Mohapatra, who had accused Kailash Kher of inappropriate behaviour, had earlier demanded the ""Teri Deewani"" singer's withdrawal from Delhi government’s Mayur Utsav.

38166,Facebook bug leaks 6.8 million users' photos to app creators,Facebook on Friday revealed that a photo API bug had leaked over 6.8 million users' photos to app developers. The leak happened between September 13 to September 25 and affected uploaded photos and not the camera roll. Facebook further announced it will roll out an alert to users and also a set of tools to help delete the leaked images.,TechCrunch,"Reset the “days since the last Facebook  privacy scandal” counter, as Facebook has just revealed a Photo API bug gave app developers too much access to the photos of up to 5.6 million users. The bug allowed apps users had approved to pull their timeline photos to also receive their Facebook Stories, Marketplace photos, and most worryingly, photos they’d uploaded to Facebook but never shared. Facebook says the bug ran for 12 days from September 13th to September 25th. Facebook tells TechCrunch it discovered the breach on September 25th, and informed the European Union’s privacy watchdog the Office Of The Data Protection Commissioner (IDPC) on November 22nd. The IDPC has begun a statuatory inquiry into the breach.Facebook provided merely a glib “We’re sorry this happened” in terms of an apology. It will provide tools next week for app developers to check if they were impacted and it will work with them to delete photos they shouldn’t have. The company plans to notify people it suspects may have been impacted by the bug via Facebook notification that will direct them to the Help Center where they’ll see if they used any apps impacted by the bug. It’s recommending users log into apps to check if they have wrongful photo access. Here’s a look at a mockup of warning notification users will see:Facebook initially didn’t disclose when it discovered the bug, but in response to TechCrunch’s inquiry, a spokesperson says that it was discovered and fixed on September 25th. They say it took time for the company to investigate which apps and people were impacted, and build and translate the warning notification it will send impacted users. The delay could put Facebook at risk of GDPR fines for not promptly disclosing the issue within 72 hours that can go up to 20 million pounds or 4 percent of annual global revenue.However, Facebook tells me it notified the IDPC that oversees GDPR on November 22nd, as soon as it established the bug was considered a reportable breach under GDPR guidelines. It says that it had to investigate to make that conclusion and let the IDPC know within 72 hours once it had. The head of communications for the IDPC Graham Doyle tells TechCrunch “The Irish DPC has received a number of breach notifications from Facebook since the introduction of the GDPR on May 25, 2018. With reference to these data breaches, including the breach in question, we have this week commenced a statutory inquiry examining Facebook’s compliance with the relevant provisions of the GDPR.”Facebook tells me the bug did not impact photos privately shared through Messenger. The bug wouldn’t have exposed photos users never uploaded to Facebook from their camera roll or computer. But photos users uploaded but either decided not to post, that got interrupted by connectivity issues, or that they otherwise never finished sharing could have winded up with app developers.The privacy failure will further weaken confidence that Facebook is a responsible steward for our private data. It follows Facebook’s massive security breach that allowed hackers to scrape 30 million people’s information back in September. There was also November’s bug allowing websites to read users’ Likes, October’s bug that mistakenly deleted people’s Live videos, and May’s bug that changed people’s status update composer privacy settings. It increasingly looks like the social network has gotten too big for the company to secure. Curiously, Facebook discovered the bug on September 25th, the same day as its 30 million user breach. Perhaps it kept a lid on the situation in hopes of not creating an even bigger scandal.That it keeps photos you partially uploaded but never posted in the first place is creepy, but the fact that these could be exposed to third-party developers is truly unacceptable. And it seems Facebook is so tired of its failings that it couldn’t put forward even a seemingly heartfelt apology is telling. This company’s troubles are not only souring users on Facebook, but employees and the tech industry as large as well. CEO Mark Zuckerberg told Congress earlier this year that “We have a responsibility to protect your data, and if we can’t then we don’t deserve to serve you.” What does Facebook deserve at this point?",https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/14/facebook-photo-bug/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,

The protests had been going on for a while within the university campus before culminating with the removal of Gandhi's statue. The faculty and student cohort from the University have cited passages written by Gandhi, which appear to be claiming that Indians were ""infinitely superior"" to black Africans. Obadele Kambon, the head of Language, Literature and Drama at the Institute of African Studies has called the removal of statue an issue of ""self-respect"" as reported by AFP. An official from Ghana's foreign affairs ministry revealed that ""its an internal decision by the university.""Meanwhile, the university officials are yet to release an official statement on the issue. India's former president Pranab Mukherjee had unveiled the Mahatma Gandhi's statue at the University of Ghana in 2016, as a symbol of cordial relations between the two nations.

Former Australia skipper Ricky Ponting, while commentating during the game, had pointed out that Ishant bowled four no-balls inside an over. But the umpire had failed to notice even one of them.An intrigued Fox Sports then took the matters in its own hands and did a thorough search only to find out that Ishant had bowled several no-balls. In fact, they revealed that the 88-Test veteran had bowled six no-balls in one over but none of them was noticed by the on-field umpire.In a report, Fox revealed, “Sharma – India’s most experienced star with 88 Tests to his name — bowling four out of six no-balls in two separate overs during the first Test. Astonishingly, one over from the towering quick in Adelaide was bowled entirely over the mark. Not a single ball was legitimate.”In the Bowlology podcast, former Australia cricketers Damien Fleming and Brad Hodge slammed the umpires while the latter went on to say that Sharma was a ‘serial offender’ when it comes to overstepping.“Seriously, the umpires have to start calling no-balls. I think they’ve got lazy. It’s runs to the batting team — how many more could have Australia got? It’s just no good for anyone,” Fleming said.Ishant, meanwhile, toiled hard in the nets ahead of the second Test to rectify his mistakes. With bowling coach B Arun standing as the umpire, Ishant worked hard on his bowling and landing in the nets.~ Written by Bijyo",https://www.crictracker.com/fox-sports-claims-ishant-sharma-bowled-six-no-balls-in-an-over-in-adelaide-test-that-werent-called/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,

He added that Shastri's statement was very immature and childish.",CricTracker,"Gautam Gambhir has been making the headlines since announcing his retirement from the game. He is never afraid to mince his words and criticised MS Dhoni‘s captaincy in 2012 recently. The left-hander has now hit back at the Indian head coach Ravi Shastri for his ‘best touring team ever’ comment. Shastri had earlier claimed that the current Indian team under Virat Kohli is the best team ever to play away from home.The coach received a lot of flak for his comments but he maintained his stance even as Team India lost the five-match Test series against by 4-1. Many former Indian cricketers weren’t pleased with him and now even Gambhir has termed his statements as childish and immature. He also claimed that Shastri hasn’t seen enough cricket else he wouldn’t have made such comments.Advertisement“I’m sure that people who haven’t won anything give these kinds of statements. I don’t know what Shastri has achieved in his career apart from winning the World Championship in Australia. I don’t think he was a part of an overseas series win. If you haven’t won anything yourself, you end up giving this kind of statement.“I’m sure people wouldn’t have taken this seriously. I’m sure he must not have seen enough cricket. If he had he seen enough cricket, he wouldn’t have given that statement,” he said while speaking to Cricket Next.Gautam Gambhir was also of the opinion that even if India had won the Test series in England, such kind of statements shouldn’t come and one should stay humble while always looking to improve. “It was very childish. Even if you had won 4-1, you won’t say this is the best Indian team touring abroad. You would still stay humble and say we want to take this, we want to go forward, we want to keep improving. You wouldn’t say this is the best Indian team ever overseas. This is childish,” the 37-year-old added.The Delhi cricketer also termed Shastri’s comments as immature and also went on to say that he wouldn’t have taken it seriously either. “I’m sure people wouldn’t have taken this seriously. I don’t know about other people but I didn’t take it seriously because it was a very immature statement,” the flamboyant left-hander who served Indian cricket for close to 15 years signed off.",https://www.crictracker.com/ravi-shastris-comments-were-childish-and-immature-says-gautam-gambhir/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,

CBI said that Wolfgang Michel was a consultant of Westland Helicopters to the Government of India during that time, according to reports.",Times Now,"New Delhi: In a stunning revelation, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has claimed that the father of Christian Michel – alleged middleman in the AgustaWestland chopper case – “knew” late Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and was “close to the Gandhi family.” The probe agency made these remarks in Michel’s remand copy submitted to the court, citing Michel's statement . As per the remand documents, accessed by Times Now, CBI said that Christian's father Wolfgang Michel, was a consultant of Westland Helicopters to Government of India in the 1970s. The probe agency informed the court that Christian claimed that his father had told him that he used to meet the Gandhis, a fact that was also told to Christian by people close to his father. ""His father knew late Indra Gandhi since 1970s and was very close to Gandhi family,"" read the document. The CBI document further referenced to an incident in 1982-83 when a question was raised in the Indian Parliament regarding the identity of 'Mr Wolfgang Michel"". The then PM Indira Gandhi is said to have replied that she ""considered him as a friend of India"", as per the CBI's remand papers. AgustaWestland case: Middleman Christian Michel sent to five-day police custodyAfter months of legal hassle, CBI was finally able to get Michel’s custody after a Dubai court allowed his extradition to India earlier in December. Michel had been wanted in India over allegations that he paid kickbacks to Indian officials in order to sway the deal for the procurement of 12 VVIP choppers in favour of AgustaWestland. The choppers were to be used to ferry the President, Prime Minister and other important dignitaries. ​Meanwhile, in its remand petition filed in the court, the CBI has said that it needed Michael in custodial remand so as to ascertain role of foreign accused persons and their contact persons in India as well as to him with the voluminous incriminating documents received from Italy and Switzerland. They also need Michel to determine names and roles of the serving IAF and other public servants who may have dealt with the procurement process of VVIP helicopters and shared classified information with him""Christian Michel had been the consultant of Agusta Westland and before that he was the consultant for Westland helicopters Ltd long before the merger of the two companies,"" CBI said. It added that during questioning, Michel revealed that his father had participated in defence deals and had known Gandhis personally. The documents submitted by the probe agency showed that Michel played a key role in the VVIP Chopper scam, Times Now reported. It added that Michel ""was instrumental in avoiding the single vendor situation in collusion with the Ministry of Defene (MOD) and Indian Air Force (IAF) officials"".

India's monthly oil imports from the Persian Gulf nation reportedly plunged to their lowest in a year after India cut purchases due to the impact of US sanctions. Iraq and Saudi Arabia continued to be the top two oil sellers to India.",Reuters,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India’s monthly oil imports from Iran plunged to their lowest in a year in November with Tehran dropping two places to become only the sixth biggest supplier after New Delhi cut purchases due to the impact of U.S. sanctions, according to ship tracking data and industry sources. Last month, the United States introduced tough sanctions aimed at crippling Iran’s oil revenue-dependent economy. Washington did, though, give a six-month waiver from sanctions to eight nations, including India, and allowed them to import some Iranian oil. India is restricted to buying 1.25 million tonnes per month, or about 300,000 barrels per day (bpd). In November, India imported about 276,000 bpd of Iranian oil, a decline of about 41 percent from October and about 4 percent more than the year-ago month, ship tracking data obtained from shipping and trade sources showed. After abandoning the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, U.S. President Donald Trump is trying to force Tehran to quash not only its nuclear ambitions and its ballistic missile program but its support for militant proxies in Syria, Yemen, Lebanon and other parts of the Middle East. India’s imports from Iran in November, included some parcels that were loaded in October. In November, Iraq and Saudi Arabia continued to be the top two oil sellers to India.  The UAE, which was the sixth biggest oil seller to India in October, became the third top seller to India in November, knocking down Venezuela by a notch to fourth position.  Nigeria continued at No. 5 position, while Iran slipped to sixth place.      “Iran do not have vessels to export oil on time ... some November loading vessels will arrive in December,” said an industry source, with knowledge of the matter. Local and international shippers are not carrying Iranian cargoes despite India winning a waiver, this source said. The key problem is that while India can import Iranian oil without falling foul of Washington, that may not apply to a shipping company signing a new delivery contract. Instead, India is relying on Iranian tankers for crude imports and Iran is using many of its vessels for crude storage. The sources declined to be identified citing the confidentiality of the numbers. Indian refiners, wary of the impact of U.S. sanctions, had boosted imports from Iran ahead of their introduction, with imports averaging about 563,000 bpd in April-November, a growth of about 32 percent from a low base in the previous fiscal year, the data showed. (For an interactive graphic on 'India's Oil Imports From Iran' click tmsnrt.rs/2SIFkfF) In the previous financial year to March 2018 India had cut oil imports from Iran due to a dispute over development rights of a giant gas field.  Iran was hoping to sell more than 500,000 bpd of oil to India in 2018/19, its oil minister Bijan Zanganeh said in February, and had offered almost free shipping and an extended credit period to boost sales to India. Government sources say Reuters’ calculations showing India’s oil imports from Iran in this fiscal year would be higher than the 452,000 bpd, or 22.6 million tonnes, it imported in the previous year, are correct. During January-November this year India’s oil imports from Iran rose by an annual 18.4 percent to 552,000 bpd, the data showed.

""You have to play ball by ball...If you are thinking about the previous ball, you won't react perfectly to the next ball,"" Vihari added.",Cricket Country,"Allrounder Hanuma Vihari feels the key for India’s batsmen will be to remain disciplined on a pitch which has got better for the fast bowlers after a good contest between ball and bat on the opening day of the second Test. The pitch was slow in the morning, but it quickened up after lunch which saw the Indian bowlers adjust well to take six wickets.ALSO READ: India keep Australia to 277/6 on up-and-down Perth surfaceVihari took two for 53 as Australia finished day one at 277-6 after being 112-0 at one stage.“For us the important thing is to not think about those aspects too much.

He didn’t have the best start but tightened up enough to snare two crucial wickets, dismissing set batsmen Marcus Harris and Shaun Marsh.“I tried to bowl a little bit quicker because I was trying to hit the surface a little bit more and get the bounce out of the wicket. That was the main idea try to keep it tight and give the seamers a rest. I knew I would have to step up if required. Overall, I was prepared for that. I was happy I could do a job for the team,” he said.“I have done a bit of bowling, even in the Ranji Trophy level, but more in limited overs. I know the idea of where I can make the batsmen play. I try to play with the fields I have. I want to keep it simple and try to do the job for the country. I know my role very well in the team. I try to keep it tight. If the wickets come, it is a bonus. My job is to make the batsman play a loose shot for his runs.”When enquired about the pitch, Vihari said it quickened up during the day. He further added that the Indian batting line-up will have to be disciplined and patient in similarly difficult conditions on day two. KL Rahul and Rishabh Pant were guilty of dropping catches, but a highlight for India in the field was Virat Kohli’s one-handed catch at second slip to dismiss Peter Handscomb.“It was a blinder. Those are the moments that change the course of the game. We needed something after lunch to change the rhythm. It was a screamer. We were lucky he had come to slip in that very over.

After the match, the Aussies received heavy criticism for not being able to capitalize on the good start they got on day 1 as India crumbled to 127 for 6 but went on to score 250 runs in the innings.The Kangaroos, known for their attacking style of cricket, are now being tagged as playing “defensive” cricket in the past year or so which has shocked the cricket pandits around the world. The most recent to criticize the defensive playing nature of the current Australian team is former Indian opener Gautam Gambhir. The southpaw was shocked by their performance in Adelaide and has also raised a point of concern for Cricket Australia which can hamper their cricket in the coming years.AdvertisementThe Delhi born former cricketer, in an exclusive interview with India TV, was quick to issue a warning for the Australian camp as he felt that their future is in grave danger if this current side is seen as the next generation Australian team without the likes of star players like Steve Smith and David Warner. The 37-years-old left-hander believes that if Tim Paine & Co. continue to play with a conservative approach it will not be possible for them to stop Team India from winning their first series ever on Australian soil.“Australia’s batting is currently their weakness. I’ve never seen an Australian side on Australian conditions score less runs.

This should be worrisome for them. A nation just cannot be dependent on just two players. This just shows that their first class structure was not like it was before. If Australia continues to play with a defensive mindset, India will win the series,” he further added.Speaking on India’s chances of winning the four-match series, Gambhir feels that skipper Virat Kohli has the necessary experience required to turn this dream into reality.

The technology giant revealed that the removal came over policy violations of the content related to spam, nudity and child safety issues. YouTube also removed over 224 million comments and nearly 1.7 million channels.",Reuters,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - YouTube took down more than 58 million videos and 224 million comments during the third quarter based on violations of its policies, the unit of Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google said on Thursday in an effort to demonstrate progress in suppressing problem content. Government officials and interest groups in the United States, Europe and Asia have been pressuring YouTube, Facebook Inc (FB.O) and other social media services to quickly identify and remove extremist and hateful content that critics have said incite violence. The European Union has proposed online services should face steep fines unless they remove extremist material within one hour of a government order to do so.  An official at India’s Ministry of Home Affairs speaking on the condition of anonymity on Thursday said social media firms had agreed to tackle authorities’ requests to remove objectionable content within 36 hours. This year, YouTube began issuing quarterly reports about its enforcement efforts. As with past quarters, most of the removed content was spam, YouTube said. Automated detection tools help YouTube quickly identify spam, extremist content and nudity. During September, 90 percent of the nearly 10,400 videos removed for violent extremism or 279,600 videos removed for child safety issues received fewer than 10 views, according to YouTube. But YouTube faces a bigger challenge with material promoting hateful rhetoric and dangerous behavior. Automated detection technologies for those policies are relatively new and less efficient, so YouTube relies on users to report potentially problematic videos or comments. This means that the content may be viewed widely before being removed.  Google added thousands of moderators this year, expanding to more than 10,000, in hopes of reviewing user reports faster. YouTube declined to comment on growth plans for 2019.  It has described pre-screening every video as unfeasible. The third-quarter removal data for the first time revealed the number of YouTube accounts Google disabled for either having three policy violations in 90 days or committing what the company found to be an egregious violation, such as uploading child pornography. YouTube removed about 1.67 million channels and all of the 50.2 million videos that were available from them.  Nearly 80 percent of the channel takedowns related to spam uploads, YouTube said. About 13 percent concerned nudity, and 4.5 percent child safety. YouTube said users post billions of comments each quarter. It declined to disclose the overall number of accounts that have uploaded videos, but said removals were also a small fraction. In addition, about 7.8 million videos were removed individually for policy violations, in line with the previous quarter.

The suspended MLA from the Aravakkurichi Assembly segment travelled from Karur to Chennai overnight and signed membership papers at the DMK headquarters in the presence of party President MK Stalin and other top functionaries.Speculation has been rife for over a week about Senthil Balaji's possible defection from the AMMK. According to sources, suspicions arose on December 5 when he failed to join the AMMK in their silent procession to former Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa's memorial. Sources from both parties had then confirmed to TNM that the former minister was likely to join the DMK.  TTV Dhinakaran had even put out a press release claiming to be unconcerned by those who leave the party. TTV said that the those who leave his party are ‘fake’, and said that the departure of people who join other parties for their own self interest will not be a source of concern for the AMMK.  TTV Dhinakaran in a statement to party cadres and members slammed those who leave the party for ‘self interests’, without naming Senthil Balaji.""I see DMK President MK Stalin as a good leader and someone who has the support of the masses. The current AIADMK government is against the people of Tamil Nadu and is working with the BJP to undermine the state,"" said Senthil Balaji, in a press meet at Arivalayam. ""In all coming elections people will support DMK and make MK Stalin the Chief Minister,"" he added.As far as his leaving the AMMK is concerned, the former minister remained very guarded in his views. He merely stated that over the last month, he had not participated in any party activities of the AMMK and believed that MK Stalin had the interests of Tamil people in his heart.TTV Dhinakaran however pointed out that Senthil Balaji had claimed that he cannot be participate in the party's activities due to personal reasons.""He told me that the cannot come for some events due to personal issues and I said okay. I however noticed he didn't come for an event held on Amma's (former CM J Jayalalithaa) death anniversary on December 5.

He is a good person and he was fine as long as he was with us,"" he added. The DMK meanwhile maintains that it is not actively seeking to bring in members of other parties into its fold.""Defections are not new as far as politics is concerned and DMK is not conniving to bring these leaders from other parties to join us.

38221,Everyone in Tesla in abusive relation with Musk: Former exec,"American magazine Wired has reported that a former executive of Elon Musk-led electric carmaker Tesla said, ""Everyone in Tesla is in an abusive relationship with Elon"". Another executive alleged Musk would say, ""I've got to fire someone today"". The employees further claimed that Musk, after his breakup with Hollywood actress Amber Heard, would say ""Going to sleep alone kills me"".",Daily Mail,"When Elon Musk announced the Model 3, a new electric sedan that would sell for just $35,000, he sent shock waves through Wall Street - and through America. Thousands of people lined up for blocks across the country in 2016 to put down a $1,000 deposit for a Model 3 car before production had even begun. In the first day alone 180,000 people had pre-ordered the Model 3. By the end of the week, that number went up to 325,000. But a new WIRED expose has revealed that Musk's mission to mass produce the affordable electric sedan would lead to dozens of top executives fleeing the company as Musk's behavior only became more and more erratic. 'Everyone in Tesla is in an abusive relationship with Elon,' one former executive declared. And those problems only to worsened as Tesla repeatedly failed to meet production goals and Musk split from Amber Heard. A new WIRED expose has revealed how Elon Musk's mission to mass produce Tesla's Model 3 would lead to dozens of top executives fleeing the company as his behavior only became more and more erratic Musk had never been the easiest of people to work with, but that wasn't unusual or surprising in a Silicon Valley that was built by eccentric - and erratic - leaders. The PayPal and SpaceX founder, who is currently worth $22billion, initially took Tesla to new heights when he invested $6.3million in the company in 2004. He became the firm's chairman and soon also was named its chief executive. Under his leadership, Tesla would go on to sell 50,000 Model S cars in 2015. The company soon became worth $7billion and Musk's star continued to rise, landing him spots on The Simpsons and Big Bang Theory as he racked up five houses in Los Angeles' swanky Bel Air neighborhood - for a total of $72million.  Musk - who has five children with first wife Justine Wilson - also began dating celebrities, marrying actress Talulah Riley before later dating Heard. 'He went from nerd famous to Hollywood famous,' said one former longtime executive. 'It changes you when you suddenly become a celebrity.'Executives revealed to WIRED that they began reading tabloids. If there were reports of trouble in Musk's relationship, they held off on telling him any bad news. When Elon Musk announced the Model 3 (pictured), a new electric sedan that would sell for just $35,000, he sent shockwaves through Wall Street - and through AmericaBut things were still going well in Tesla, thanks in part to the fact that Musk was surrounded by people who had been there for a while and knew 'how to push back on him', according to one former executive. 'He listened to us when we said he needed to dial it down,' they added. 'But then the Model 3 happened and everyone started leaving, and then everything started falling apart.' The original plan for the Model 3 was already ambitious. Tesla had sold fewer than 150,000 cars total. Now it was planning to make 5,000 Model 3 cars a week. 'You are now working at a different company,' Doug Field, the company's senior vice president of engineering, told his staff. 'Everything has changed.' Little did everyone know that Musk had been dreaming of far more changes - inspired by a literal dream. He wanted a manufacturing plant that was fully automated, one in which robots built everything at high speed and conveyor belts delivered parts at exactly the right time.Musk wanted his departments to completely rebuild their manufacturing plants for the Model 3, telling them: 'We're going to build the machine that builds the machine'.The announcement completely shocked the company. Engineers began handing in their notices as executives tried to push back on Musk's plan. But he wouldn't relent. Whenever someone raised an alarm, Musk would pull their manager aside - sometimes to reassign them, sometimes to fire them, it is claimed.But Musk sent shockwaves through his own company when he declared he wanted the Model 3 manufacturing plant (pictured) to be fully automated, one in which robots built everything 'If you were the kind of person who was likely to push back, you got disinvited, because VPs didn't want anyone pissing off Elon,' said one former executive. 'People were scared that someone would question something.' As the company started burning through an estimated $100million a week, Musk only became more and more frustrated. In one meeting, Musk was so furious he broke a phone, it is claimed. In another, he angrily called an executive who hadn't attended because his wife had recently given birth. He reportedly once refused to interview a job candidate because they were wearing blue shoes. 'Everyone came to work each day wondering if it was going to be their last day,' one former executive said. Another remembered Musk coming to work and declaring 'I've got to fire someone today'. 'I'd say, ""No, you don't"" and he'd say, ""No, no. I just do. I've got to fire somebody,'"" the executive recalled. Fast-forward a year and the company was still severely struggling. And now customers were asking for their Model 3 deposits back. As the company continued to struggle, Musk split from girlfriend Amber Heard and became more desolate as he told one Rolling Stone reporter he was in 'severe emotional pain'Still Tesla tried to drum up some good press, presenting the first 30 Model 3 customers at a party at the company's Fremont factory. But their leader was desolate. Musk, who had recently broken up with Heard, instead told the press that Tesla was about to embark on 'six months of manufacturing hell'. 'Sorry for being a little dry,' he added, 'got a lot on my mind right now.' One former high-ranking executive said the event was a turning point - the beginning of a 'downward spiral'. '[Musk] was always a mad genius, but he was about 95 percent genius and 5 percent mad,' the executive said. 'The ratio started to shift, and by the fall it was totally inverted.' Musk's firings only accelerated, at one point becoming so bad that one manager forbade his staff from going near their leader's desk. Many employees - even brand new ones - learned that one chance encounter could end their career. Such was the case for one young employee at Gigafactory, Tesla's battery manufacturing plant in Nevada. Musk's firings at Tesla began to accelerate, at one point becoming so bad that one manager forbade his staff from going near their leader's desk. Pictured is the Gigafactory 2 in New YorkMusk had called on the employee over an issue with the production line, telling him simply 'This doesn't work!' 'Did you do this?' Musk then asked. The employee had never met Musk before, and he had no idea what exactly Musk was talking about. 'You mean, program the robot? Or design the tool?' the engineer asked. 'Did you f*****g do this?' Musk reportedly asked again. 'I'm not sure what you're referring,' the engineer told him, an apology in his voice. 'You're a f*****g idiot,' Musk allegedly replied. 'Get the f**k out and don't come back!'   A few minutes later, the employee found out he had been officially fired.  'We called it the ""idiot bit,'"" one senior executive told WIRED. 'If you said something wrong or made one mistake or rubbed him the wrong way, he would decide you're an idiot and there was nothing that could change his mind.' 'It started to feel like every day you expected to be fired,' another added. 'There was this constant feeling of dread.' One spokesman told WIRED that Musk only fired those who were 'underperforming'. Then, in August, Musk sent out a tweet that would cost him $20million and his chairmanship of Tesla's boardThe story only got weirder as rapper Azealia Banks claimed she had witnessed Musk breaking down to his girlfriend Grimes (pictured together) over the tweet. She even claimed he sent it while on acid'Elon cares very deeply about the people who work at his companies,' they said in a statement. 'That is why, although it is painful, he sometimes takes the difficult step of firing people who are underperforming.' 'In order for Tesla to succeed, we must have extremely high standards and work harder and smarter than everyone else.' 'Sometimes, when we feel it's important to the success of our mission, that means people are let go.' Eventually 700 people would be let go, and more than 36 Tesla vice presidents or higher-ranking staff would leave the company - including the company's chief information officer and vice presidents of manufacturing and engineering. 'It felt like the adults were leaving the building,' one senior employee said. 'There was really no one left would could push back on Elon anymore.'  Meanwhile, Musk's interviews were only getting more and more bizarre, even telling a Rolling Stone reporter that he was in 'severe emotional pain'.'I will never be happy without having someone,' he added. 'Going to sleep alone kills me.' By April, Musk finally admitted that 'excessive automation' was his mistake. Two months later, Tesla finally hit its goal of 5,000 Model 3 cars in one week. Musk was over the moon, telling employees that Tesla had finally become a 'real car company'. And yet, he personally continued to spiral, it is claimed.His tweeting became rampant that summer as he called one critic a 'sanctimonious idiot' and told a Buzzfeed reporter in an email that he was a 'f*****g a**hole'.   Musk called a cave diver who helped rescue the trapped Thailand boys that he was a pedophile, and told one Wall Street analyst he had asked a 'boneheaded question' during a company call about Tesla's latest earnings.  Musk only found himself making more headlines a month later, when he smoked marijuana during an appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience podcastThen, in August, Musk sent out a tweet that would cost him $20million and his chairmanship of Tesla's board. 'Am considering taking Tesla private at $420,' he wrote. 'Funding secured.' But no such funding was secured, and days the story only got weirder as rapper Azealia Banks claimed she had witnessed Musk breaking down over the tweet. 'I waited around all weekend while [girlfriend] Grimes coddled her boyfriend for being too stupid to know not to go on Twitter on acid,' Banks wrote, referring to Musk's girlfriend. 'I saw him in the kitchen tucking his tail in between his legs scrounging for investors to cover his a** after that tweet.' Musk later revealed that he had chosen the $420 price because he had 'recently learned of the number's significance in marijuana culture' and thought Grimes 'would find it funny'.   The Securities and Exchange Commission sued Musk for fraud - which has since been settled - and the Department of Justice has opened a criminal fraud probe. Musk only found himself making more headlines a month later, when he smoked marijuana during an appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast. Now NASA is also investigating Musk's SpaceX and Boeing companies to ensure they are adhering to the requirements for a 'drug-free environment'.  'For a long time, Elon would say or do something kind of wacky, and I would get up in front of my team and explain, this is why you shouldn't worry about it,' said one former executive. 'But eventually it got to where I couldn't apologize anymore.' Ask some Tesla employees now, and they will say that the company has succeeded in spite of Musk - not because of him. 'When people were shielded from Elon, Tesla was amazing,' a high-ranking engineer executive said. 'We did incredible things.' ",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6492707/New-expose-claims-Teslas-Model-3-car-sent-Elon-Musk-spiraling-control.html?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,

Singh further said that the International Hockey Federation (FIH) needs to address the issue. India lost 1-2 to the Netherlands in the fourth and last quarterfinal.,Times Now,"Bhubaneswar: India's chief coach Harendra Singh Thursday blamed poor umpiring for his team's early ouster from the ongoing men's hockey World Cup here. He said the International Hockey Federation (FIH) needs to seriously address the issue as his side has been on the receiving end of poor on-field decisions twice this year. Aiming to rewrite history after a hiatus of 43 years, India lost 1-2 to the Netherlands in the fourth and last quarterfinal, crashing out in front of a packed Kalinga Stadium.Harendra said it's high time the FIH reviews the performance of umpires. ""I would like to tender my apologies. We haven't given what we had to. I am not going to stop today. If they (umpires) don't want to improve, we will continue to face these type of results,"" he said at the post-match press conference.""Can anyone define Amit Rohidas's 10-min yellow card? What about this gentleman (pointing at Manpreet Singh), when he was pushed from behind? Why not a yellow card there? We have lost two major tournaments (Asian Games) this year because of umpiring.""Two times we got a card when we hadn't done anything. But when it happened against us, they (umpires) said nothing. They need to improve. We have lost two major tournaments,"" he added. The India coach, however, said he will not lodge any protest and accept the result.""99.8 percent the referral goes in favour of players. The outcome of a protest has never been good in my career. We accept this gracefully. We want neutral umpiring. I except both teams to be treated equally. One wrong decision can ruin your preparation of 4-6 years,"" he said.India captain Manpreet Singh too was utterly disappointed with the outcome and said there is no point in lodging a protest now. ""What is the use? We lost. We are out of the tournament,"" he said.""The team had put in all the effort, but it didn't happen. I am happy that all boys gave their 100 per cent and were not short on confidence."" Harendra said it was an equal contest but missed chances hurt India badly.
""We had a couple of open chances. We missed, so did Holland. That was because both teams were playing high-tempo game. Sometimes your position is not there, or your stick is not there (in the right place). The way the boys fought without the goalkeeper, in front of you I want to salute my players.""""We played well in patches but I will give 7 out of 10 on temperament to my team."" Criticising the on-field umpires, Harendra further said he didn't think the penalty corner from which Netherlands scored their winner, was right. ""The penalty corner which they got, I don't agree with it,"" he said.Netherlands coach Max Caldas, however, disagreed with his Indian counterpart and said it is not wise to blame the umpires after a defeat. ""The team with most chances wins the game. We won the game. That's the bottom line. In the end, the umpires didn't play the game. We never discuss umpires after a game, we talk about our own performance,"" he said.""We review games, not umpires. We review our own performance. It happened with us at the Champions Trophy when the call went against us and we had a draw against India. Umpires do their job. It's a very fast-paced game,"" Caldas added.The Dutch captain Billy Bakker too agreed with his coach on the umpiring issue. ""I think we are pretty happy with the officials.

He also demanded a law to ensure that cases of cow vigilantism and mob lynching do not take place in the state.This is not the first time that a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-ruled state has made such a demand. Earlier in September, Uttarakhand became the first state which demanded that cow be considered the mother of the nation.In the month of June, a Rajasthan High Court judge had demanded that the cow should be considered as the national animal. Days after the suggestion, a Hyderabad high court judge termed cow as a ‘substitute to Mother and God’. The judge also considered the animal to be a ‘sacred national wealth’.The resolution was passed by the Himachal Pradesh Assembly after numerous cases related to cow vigilantism and lynching surfaced from various parts of the country in recent times.On October 16, 2015, a man from Uttar Pradesh was lynched by mob in Sirmaur district of Himachal Pradesh for allegedly smuggling cows. His four other accomplices were later arrested by the police with the help of locals.In May 2017, Union Minister Nitin Gadkar, with reference to cow vigilantism, said that such cases have only brought about a spike in the communal tensions, thereby tarnishing Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s efforts to focus on economic development.He added that the focus of the government is only on ‘Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas’ (Together with all, Development for all), and none of its policies discriminated against religious minorities.(With Agency inputs)",https://www.india.com/news/india/himachal-pradesh-assembly-passes-resolution-to-declare-cow-rashtra-mata-3473297/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,

""We made the decision to return because it was absolutely necessary to deliver the shipment to its destination...as quickly as possible,"" a Southwest Airlines spokesperson said.",Daily Mail,"A commercial flight from Seattle to Dallas was forced to turn back after stewards realized a human heart had not been offloaded for clinical use.Southwest Airlines was tasked with flying the heart from Sacramento to Washington, where an unidentified hospital was awaiting the organ.But the team forgot to unload it - and simply prepared the plane for its next flight to Dallas.It wasn't until they had flown over Idaho and were nearing Wyoming that the team realized.Immediately they turned around, explaining the situation to passengers over the speakers.Southwest Airlines was tasked with flying the heart from Sacramento to Washington, where an unidentified hospital was awaiting the organ. But the team forgot to unload it (file image)Dr Andrew Gottschalk, a New Orleans sports doctor who was on the flight, told the Seattle Times that there was a ripple of panic before most passengers accepted that getting a heart to its destination was more important. But he said he, like others on board, felt it was a 'horrific story of gross negligence.' 'The heart in question traveled from California, to Washington, to the other side of Idaho, and back to Washington,' he said.   Hearts and lungs destined for transplant are not typically transported in commercial flights, since there is a four- to six-hour window allowed between removing the organ and transplanting it.  Kidneys are often shipped commercially, since they have a preservation time of 24 to 36 hours. Generally they are not accompanied. But according to Joel Newman, assistant communications director at the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS), the only way a heart would ever be transported on a commercial flight would be for research, or if they were merely using some tissue or valves.  'Hearts and lungs have the shortest preservation time,' Newman told DailyMail.com. 'So if a human heart were intended for transplantation it would be very unlikely to be traveling over a great distance. Either ground transportation or a charter plane would be more likely.'If the heart is being used whole it cannot be frozen; it is kept in a container with sterile layers and biological matter to keep it fresh. If it's destined for research, though, it can be frozen. 'You can recover heart valves or skin or bone or corneas, and they could be kept for a longer period of time,' Newman explained. As for who's in charge of a commercially-flown organ: it flies solo. Newman explains that there is typically someone mandated to get the organ to the airport where it is passed through the security x-rays (with care not to open the layers of the sterile packaging) and put on the flight. But from then it's unaccompanied, in the hands of the stewards, until they get to the other end. The only exception would be if it requires a special device with it, in which case a technician would be on board. It's not clear who was in charge of the heart flying on Southwest, and who was mandated to pick it up at the other end.  Every Seattle hospital denied being part of this scenario.  Katherine Pliska, spokeswoman for LifeCenter Northwest, the top organization for organ procurement in the Northwest, also denied involvement. Pliska told the Seattle Times: 'We only use private flights. There's a time limit to get where it needs to go.'Southwest Airlines spokesman Dan Landson told the Times: 'Nothing is more important to us than the safety of our customers and the safe delivery of the precious cargo we transport every day.'",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-6493071/Human-HEART-left-board-Southwest-plane-forces-pilot-turnaround-mid-flight.html?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,

38275,ISRO to reuse dead rockets in space for science experiments,"Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) is planning to reuse PSLV rocket's last stage, which becomes ""dead"" after it releases the primary satellite in orbit. The new technology will use the dead rocket as a satellite and will be demonstrated during PSLV-C44 launch in January 2019. Notably, ISRO will be the first-ever space agency to achieve the feat.",BGR,"ISRO is working on a new technology that could add life to dead rockets in space. A dead rocket in space is generally considered to be nothing but debris but ISRO believes that it can be useful. The Indian Space Research Organisation is working on a technology that will use the last stage of its Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) for space experiments.The technology demonstration of this new system will be performed when the space agency launches the PSLV C44 rocket in January. Normally, the last stage of a rocket becomes dead after releasing the primary satellite in space and is categorized as debris. However, it remains in the same orbit as that of the released satellite.“Now, we are working on a new technology where we will give life to this “dead” last stage of PSLV, also called PS4 stage, for six months after its launch,” K Sivan, ISRO Chairman told TOI. “This rocket stage will double up as a satellite. This will be the most cost-effective way to perform experiments in space as we don’t have to launch a separate rocket for the purpose,” he added.“India is the only country in the world that is working on this new technology,” Sivan claimed while explaining the technology. ISRO plans to make the rocket stage of PSLC C44 alive with the help of a new system that will include batteries and solar panel. The PSLV C44 is scheduled to carry a microsat as the primary satellite in January.Even after the primary stage separates from the PSLV, the last stage of the rocket will remain active. ISRO plans to use it as an experimental platform for new space technologies. Students or space scientists can attach their micro or nano satellites to this last stage and carry out experiments after the primary stage is separated.“ISRO can do the same with the GSLV rocket as well where we can use its last stage as an experimental platform,” Sivan added. He confirmed that the space agency will soon invite proposals from students and space scientists to make use of its technology.Space agencies around the world use a rocket only once to deliver satellites in space.

38283,1st tied Test match was caused by direct hit off penultimate ball,"Australia needed one run off two balls with one wicket remaining when Windies' Joe Solomon's direct hit resulted in the first-ever tied Test. The match's last over, consisting of eight balls, involved a leg-bye, bye, caught behind, dropped catch, and two run-outs. The first-ever tied Test ended on December 14, 1960, almost 84 years since the first Test in 1877.",Cricket Country,"On December 14, 1960, Joe Solomon threw down the stumps from square-leg to run out Ian Meckiff, and Test cricket witnessed the first ever Tie. Arunabha Sengupta recounts the tension-filled last few moments of the match.They just touched the ball and ran like whippets. And slowly the Australians started squeezing out of the stranglehold of Wes Hall and the other West Indians.Between the stolen singles and twos, Alan Davidson cut and hooked with vicious grace. He had walked in with the score reading 57 for 5, Hall on rampage. At the other end captain Richie Benaud looked unruffled. When he had come in at 92 for 6, all had looked lost.The plan had been to scatter the fielders with some audacious running. And it seemed to be working.In the dressing room, all padded up, Wally Grout chain-smoked his way for 2 hours. Ian Meckiff and Lindsay Kline, rank tailenders, cast anxious glances at the nervous wreck supposed to go in before them. They did not see much to reassure themselves.Meanwhile, at four o’clock, commentator Alan McGilvray had left the ground saying that the match was over. The spectators who lived in Sydney had booked the 5.45 plane. Some stayed back and some risked leaving. Many were forced to go because of earlier commitments. Several confessed that it had been the biggest mistake of their lives. Watching all the remaining Tests did not make up for it.The swinging pendulumAfter four days of trading blows in the first Test, the visitors seemed to be destined to come out on top.On the first day, Garry Sobers had played one of the greatest knocks ever seen in Australia. The breathless innings would remain close to his heart. When years later Lindsay Kline told him, “that wonderful innings you played, that 130 was fantastic,” the legend responded, “Lindsay, it was 132”. Sobers scored plenty of hundreds in his career, but every detail of this one was precious. It had made the Brisbane crowd delirious for 3 hours.However, Alan Davidson, that human machine who ticked over hour after hour with the same relentless accuracy, captured five wickets and kept the West Indians down to 453 – in spite of fifties by Frank Worrell and Joe Solomon and an entertaining half century by Hall with his haymaker swings.Australia had responded well. Norman O’Neill, not really at his best, had fought hard to notch his highest Test score of 181. Several deliveries of Hall had left angry marks on him. Colin McDonald had been hit painfully on the knee by the West Indian pacer, but had hobbled to 57. Bobby Simpson had sedately progressed to 92 before a rush of blood towards the end of the second day had seen his stumps disturbed by Sonny Ramadhin. And Alan Davidson had peerlessly left his signature in every phase of the game by scoring 44. The home team led by 52 after first innings exchanges.On the fourth day, Davidson had cast a magic spell. With 6 wickets — 11 for the match — he had swung the match towards Australia. When he had bowled Hall on the final morning, Australia had needed 233 in 310 minutes.The chaseIt was expected to be a routine chase. “When I walked through the gate and along the side of the pavilion to the dressing rooms, I could see white flowers dotting the turf; clover flowers. It was obvious that the ground hadn’t been mown this morning. I ask for a mowing, but the curator tells me there was a heavy shower just after seven o’clock and he hasn’t been able to get the mower on the ground… now he hasn’t the time to do it. I don’t s’pose it matters a great deal really, we’ll only have a bit over 200 to make,” Benaud recalls.But, it was not going to be easy. Hall later wrote in his autobiography, “I was fresh, marvellously fresh. I hurtled into the attack with a vigour which even I found a little amazing. I seemed to be propelled by a jet during that early onslaught.”With new boots that produced enormous blisters, Hall charged in and generated pace like fire. Simpson went for a duck, Harvey for 5, the promising O’Neill for 26 — all to the big Barbadian bowler with the crucifix dangling from his neck. McDonald battled for one-and-a-half hours before being bowled by Worrell. Hall knocked over Les Favell, and Ramadhin managed to spin one past Ken Mackay’s defence just as he was settling down.With 124 needed in 120 minutes, four wickets in hand, Don Bradman approached Richie Benaud during the Tea interval.“What is it going to be?” asked the great man.“Well, we’re going for a win,” replied Benaud.“I’m very pleased to hear it,” replied Sir Donald.And then came the push and run tactics, resulting in overthrows, misfields and wild returns. The excitable men in the West Indian camp were feeling the heat, and the serene Worrell did a magnificent job of keeping them under control.The match soon started slipping away and by the middle of the last session, Australia was again established on top.Davidson and Benaud batted on, charting a fascinating fight-back. With 11 wickets and 44 in the first innings, now the left-handed all-rounder unfurled a splendid second innings.Combining cheeky running and some bold hits to the fence, the partnership was on its way to finishing the match. And the game was all but sewn up, end well within sight. With 12 minutes left, Davidson was on 80, Benaud on 52. Seven runs remained to win, and the last four wickets still intact.At this stage, Benaud played a few dot balls from Sobers and then pushed one to the leg side and called for a single. A tiring Davidson was perhaps a little slow to react.  Solomon, 25 yards out and square to the wicket, swooped down on the ball like an eagle and hit the wicket. “If I’d have been Usain Bolt I wouldn’t have made my ground,” Davidson recalled recently.The new man, Wally Grout, walked in and could not find his gloves. They had slipped inside the roll of his pads.He nervously looked around, fidgeted and sweated before managing to find them and taking guard. A single ended the over.The last over6 runs were required off one of those long eight-ball overs used in Australia, and it was the eighteenth to be bowled by Hall.The first ball reared up, hit Grout a crippling blow on the solar plexus and dropped in front of his toes. Benaud scampered across like an Olympic sprinter, and Grout grunted and hobbled in response, clutching his midriff, somehow crawling into the safety of the non-striker’s end. 5 remained off 7 balls.A few overs earlier Worrell had warned Hall to cut down on the bouncers.Now, with Australia a stroke away from victory Benaud stood in front of him, a compulsive hooker and well-set on 52. For some reason, Hall decided to pitch the ball well within the bowler’s half of the pitch. The ball screamed through head high, Benaud hooked, and it went to Gerry Alexander off the glove.Two wickets remained as Benaud walked back.Ian Meckiff patted the ball back quietly back to Hall.  5 were now required from 5 balls.As Hall let go of the next ball, Grout ran with it. Meckiff missed it completely and hared down the wicket as it went through to Alexander. A confused Hall ended up at the batsman’s crease and a calm Worrell at the non-striker’s end preventing overthrows. The end result was a bye. 4 runs remained to be scored from 4 balls.And now, in his second act of direct disobedience of the captain’s instructions, Hall bounced again. Grout, who fancied himself against the short stuff, essayed a hook and the ball ballooned off the top edge. It hovered in the air for an eternity, above the square leg region, with Kanhai and Alexander both in excellent position to pouch it, with lots of time to get there. Worrell later wrote, “How Wes ever got there I will never know,” but the fast bowler had somehow reversed direction from his follow through,  galloped down to square-leg, hit Kanhai on the head with his elbow, fumbled with the ball and let it drop to the turf.“The Good Lord’s gone and left us,” Hall exclaimed, startling the square-leg umpire Col Hoy.In all this commotion, batsmen had taken a single, and 3 runs remained to win in 3 balls.Hall charged in again and Meckiff hit hard and high to the leg side. The boundary fence seemed to drag the ball towards it like a magnet. And according to Benaud, it was stopped by one of those outgrowths that had not been mown that morning. The batsmen completed two and turned for what could have been the winning run. Conrad Hunte sprinted to pick the ball up and sent in a spectacular return. Grout dove for the crease, grazing his elbows, but Alexander had the bails off in a flash. The entire ground focused on umpire Hoy, and up went his finger.The scores were tied.During the previous over, Kline had asked Colin McDonald, “I won’t have to go in, will I?” The opener had responded reassuringly, “No, I don’t think so”.And then, as those wickets were lost, Kline had tried to pad up and couldn’t find his gloves. After a desperate search, he discovered he was sitting on them.Now, he took strike and Worrell walked over from mid-off and quietly said to his fast bowler, “Whatever you do Wes, don’t bowl a no-ball. They will never let you back in Barbados.”Hall’s right foot was well behind the line as he hurled down his seventh thunderbolt of the over. Kline timed it beautifully to square leg and the two men started sprinting across the 22 yards.Peter Lashley at midwicket had rushed towards it when he heard, “Move, move, move” from a charging Solomon. It was towards the wrong arm of the Guyanese batsman, and he could see just one stump. But, Solomon pounced on the ball and released it with the same the bull’s eye accuracy that he had shown an over earlier. Meckiff was short of his ground. And pandemonium broke loose.Meckiff thought Australia had lost “Fancy losing like that,” he mouthed to Kline as they walked back morosely. West Indians too thought they had won. It could not be a draw when the batting side was all out in the second innings, could it? On the radio it was announced that West Indies had won by one run.“We were coming off the field a little bit concerned. We knew we hadn’t won, but at the same time we knew we hadn’t lost. It was a little difficult at the time to appreciate things in perspective,” Alexander recalled.It was Bradman who came in and told Davidson, “You’ve made history.”As things cooled down in the pavilion, the truth dawned.Australians came pouring into the West Indian dressing-room. Champagne flowed. West Indian manager Gerry Gomez did a jig with Norman O’Neill.The following Tests were played with that same heady mix of camaraderie and competitiveness — resulting in perhaps the greatest series of all time.Almost two years later, a South Narango peanut farmer revealed to Wes Hall that he had grabbed the historic ball as it had spun out of Ramadhin’s hands.As over 3,000 people jostled in front of the pavilion, this gentleman had clutched on to this souvenir and made a run for it. Hall recognised the ball from the large split across the seam on one side. A taxi driver had offered him £50 for it, but the proud cricket fan had refused to part with the priceless souvenir.(Arunabha Sengupta is a cricket historian and Chief Cricket Writer at CricketCountry.

38284,"What is a drop-in pitch, being used for 2nd Australia-India Test?","The second Australia-India Test is being played on a drop-in pitch at the Optus Stadium in Perth. A drop-in pitch is prepared away from the venue in which it is used, and is dropped into the site by a crane. Weighing around 30 tons and having 20-cm depth, a drop-in pitch is maintained in a steel frame.",Reuters,"PERTH (Reuters) - The shiny new Perth Stadium is expected to conjure up nostalgia-tinged memories of its fiery predecessor, offering conditions a desperate Australia hope will spur a series-leveling victory over India in the second test starting on Friday. The 60,000-seat arena will host its first test after a rich 47-year run at the nearby WACA, located on the opposite bank of the Swan River, and the grassy drop-in wicket unveiled on Thursday has fuelled anticipation of a pace bowler’s paradise. Recent results suggest that will be the case as ball has thoroughly dominated matches at the Burswood stadium this season, including Australia’s tame dismissal for 152 in a heavy one-day international defeat to South Africa last month. Australia had enjoyed a stranglehold over opponents on the fast and bouncy WACA wicket, losing just four tests in the past two decades. Three of those defeats were to South Africa, who relished the pace-friendly conditions similar to their homeland. India’s famous 72-run victory in 2008 was their sole triumph at the WACA, halting a Ricky Ponting-led Australia’s world-record equalling 16-match winning streak. The tourists were humiliated by an innings and 37 runs four years later, the last time India played a test in Perth. After falling short by 31 runs in Adelaide, captain Tim Paine still has plenty of concerns about an inexperienced lineup, although Australia named an unchanged side for the test with struggling opener Aaron Finch retaining his place. The absence of the suspended Steve Smith and David Warner was exposed in Adelaide, where Australia made modest scores of 235 and 291 against a disciplined Indian attack as Shaun Marsh and Travis Head were the only home batsmen to hit fifties. Australia’s woes extend to spearhead Mitchell Starc, who has been under the microscope having taken just 12 wickets in his past five tests, and his major control issues in India’s second innings would not have improved his confidence. Paine, on a positive note, is fit to play after he appeared to injure his troubled right index finger on the final day in Adelaide. He said his team was wary of India’s momentum after the visitors won their first ever series-opener in Australia. “They have a bit of a sniff of something special,” Paine told reporters. “We know it’s going to be a highly competitive test and a huge challenge for our whole group.” A confident India have been dealt a double injury blow, however, with batsman Rohit Sharma and spin spearhead Ravichandran Ashwin, who took 6-149 in Adelaide, ruled out on the eve of the Perth test. In-form pace trio Mohammed Shami, Jasprit Bumrah and Ishant Sharma remain available as India strive for a maiden test series triumph in Australia. “I was pretty happy to see the pitch the way it is,” India captain Virat Kohli said.  “I hope that no more grass is taken off the pitch because that will mean the first three days will be, obviously, very lively and we, as a team, are happy with that.” Even though the four-test series started in nail-biting fashion, ticket sales have reportedly been sluggish with just 20,000 spectators expected on a scorching opening day with temperatures set to hit 38 degrees Celsius.

38287,Nissan sues sister of fired chairman for 'unjust enrichment',"Japanese carmaker Nissan has sued ousted chairman Carlos Ghosn's sister on Tuesday in a Rio de Janeiro court for ""unjust enrichment"". Brazil-born Ghosn is accused of having underreported his income and is currently being held in a prison in Japan. Reports had said that Ghosn's sister was paid $100,000 a year as remuneration for a non-existent ""advisory role"" since 2002.",Reuters,"SAO PAULO/TOKYO (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co (7201.T) has filed a court claim against Carlos Ghosn’s sister that references alleged “unjust enrichment”, escalating a battle being waged in Brazilian courts between the car maker and its once-celebrated former chairman. A court docket dated Dec. 11 that was seen by Reuters showed the Japanese automaker filed a claim against Claudine Bichara de Oliveira. The docket showed Nissan as the claimant and Oliveira as the defendant, with the subject title “unjust enrichment”. Further details were not immediately available.   Nissan said the claim, which sought a stay on the statute of limitations on a document created three years earlier, would allow it the option of pursuing further legal action. “At this point, this is just a notice to protect Nissan’s interest from the statute of limitation,” the company said in an emailed response, when asked about the claim. “It is not specifically a request for a judgment against Oliveira.” Nissan declined to elaborate on the document, or on the allegations against Oliveira. A representative for the Ghosn family did not respond to a request for comment on the filing.  Oliveira did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Brazilian-born Ghosn was arrested last month and indicted this week in Japan for allegedly under-reporting his income. Nissan also accuses him of diverting company funds to pay for personal expenses. He has been held in detention in Japan since his arrest. Sources familiar with the matter told Reuters that Ghosn’s office had formed an advisory role for Oliveira and compensated her, although an internal investigation by Nissan had found no evidence of any such work being done. The sources requested anonymity because the information is not public. The Ghosn family representative did not respond to a request for comment. Nissan is already fighting Ghosn and his daughter Caroline to secure the contents of a beachfront apartment in Rio de Janeiro that Ghosn used when he ran the company, and which it says may contain evidence of wrongdoing. Ghosn and his daughter had sued to retrieve what they said were personal items, such as photographs, jewelry, watches and books. On Thursday, Nissan faced a setback as an appellate judge ruled that Ghosn or his daughter must be allowed into the apartment during a 24-hour period to retrieve personal belongings. The decision called for two judicial officers to be present, and also allows Nissan representatives to be present. It was not immediately clear whether Nissan could appeal the decision. The Rio de Janeiro apartment has become the center of a side battle to the criminal investigation in Japan, which Nissan says was the result of an internal probe into Ghosn’s wrongdoing following a tip from an informant. Nissan says it has found three safes in the flat that could contain evidence of Ghosn’s alleged crimes. In court papers, lawyers for Ghosn said that since Nissan had entered the apartment after his arrest, the automaker could have “inserted objects or documents that could compromise his good reputation”.

38291,US Senate votes to end military support for Saudis in Yemen war,The US Senate has voted 56-41 to end US military support for the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen's civil war. It is the first time either chamber of Congress has backed a resolution to withdraw US forces from a military engagement under the War Powers Act. The Senate also blamed Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for journalist Jamal Khashoggi's murder.,Reuters,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate delivered a rare double rebuke to President Donald Trump on Saudi Arabia on Thursday, voting to end U.S. military support for the war in Yemen and blame the Saudi crown prince for the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.         The votes were largely symbolic because to become law the resolutions would have to pass the House of Representatives, whose Republican leaders have blocked any legislation intended to rebuke the Saudis. In a historic move, Senators voted 56-41 to end U.S. military support for the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen’s civil war. The conflict has killed tens of thousands of people and spawned what the United Nations calls the world’s most dire human crisis, with the country on the brink of famine.  It was the first time either chamber of Congress had backed a resolution to withdraw U.S. forces from a military engagement under the War Powers Act. That law, passed in 1973, limits the president’s ability to commit U.S. forces to potential hostilities without congressional approval. Seven of Trump’s fellow Republicans joined Senate Democrats to back the measure. Immediately after the Yemen vote, the Senate backed a resolution blaming Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for Khashoggi’s murder and insisting that Saudi Arabia hold accountable anyone responsible for his death. Khashoggi, a U.S. resident who was a columnist for the Washington Post, was killed inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October. The Senate vote, which was unanimous, puts pressure on House leaders to allow a vote on the Khashoggi resolution this month, before Congress adjourns for the year. “Unanimously, the United States Senate has said that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is responsible for the murder of Jamal Khashoggi. That is a strong statement. I think it speaks to the values that we hold dear,” said Republican Senator Bob Corker, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee and sponsor of the resolution. Trump has said he wants Washington to stand by the Saudi government and the prince, despite a CIA assessment it was likely he ordered Khashoggi’s killing. He promised to veto the war powers resolution. Opponents of the resolution are reluctant to take any action to disrupt the strategic U.S. relationship with Saudi Arabia, seen as an essential counterweight in the Middle East to Iran, arch-enemy of close U.S. ally Israel.  Administration officials also see Saudi support as a linchpin for an Israeli-Palestinian peace plan yet to be unveiled by the Trump administration. And they have argued that ending U.S. support could complicate Yemen peace talks. Asked to comment on the Khashoggi resolution, a White House spokesperson noted sanctions imposed on 17 Saudis over the killing and said, “Our shared strategic interests with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia remain, and we continue to view as achievable the twin imperatives of protecting America and holding accountable those responsible for the killing.” But backers of the resolutions, including some Republicans, promised to press ahead. On Wednesday, a bipartisan group of senators promised to push in the new Congress legislation for humanitarian sanctions and a ban on weapons sales to Saudi Arabia. “What’s next is to do everything possible to demand that the House of Representatives do what the members of the House want done, an opportunity to vote on this,” Senator Bernie Sanders told Reuters. Sanders, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, said he would bring the resolution up again after the new Congress convenes in January, when Democrats will control the House of Representatives. The measure could pass the Senate again, given the bipartisan support it received on Thursday, even though Trump’s Republicans will have a larger majority in the upper chamber next year. “I think we’re going to win in the Senate and I think we are going to do what the American people want, that is to end our participation in this horrific and destructive war,” Sanders said. There was no immediate word from House leadership on whether they would allow a vote on either resolution. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, who briefed House members on Thursday, urged senators during a briefing last month to keep supporting the Saudi-led coalition. Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi said her members supported congressional action. “There certainly is an appetite in our caucus for that,” Pelosi, who is expected to be the next House Speaker, told reporters. Yemen’s warring parties agreed on Thursday to cease fighting for the Houthi-held port city of Hodeidah and withdraw their troops, the first significant breakthrough for U.N.-led peace efforts in five years of conflict.

Former Maldivian President and head of the country's delegation at the UN climate talks, Mohamed Nasheed called upon other nations to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, calling climate change a national security issue.",Reuters,"KATOWICE, Poland (Reuters) - The Maldives will do all in its power to keep “our heads above water”, the head of its delegation at U.N. climate talks said on Thursday in an impassioned appeal for nations to overcome their divisions over how to tackle global warming. The low-lying Maldives is among countries most vulnerable to the effects of climate change such as rising sea levels and coral reef deterioration. “We are not prepared to die. We are not going to become the first victims of the climate crisis. Instead, we are going to do everything in our power to keep our heads above water,” Mohamed Nasheed told delegates at the talks in Katowice, Poland. “Climate change is a national security issue for us. It is an existential threat,” he said, adding that a rise in global temperatures could still be avoided but countries had to unite. Nasheed was the Maldives’ first democratically elected leader but was ousted in 2012 in a coup, imprisoned then granted asylum in Britain. The Maldives’ current president, Ibrahim Mohamed Solih, invited Nasheed to head the country’s negotiating delegation at the Katowice talks, which are aimed at agreeing rules for implementing the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change. With less than two days until the conference is formally scheduled to end, delegates are still grappling with many issues - not just how the accord will be implemented - including finance, strengthening emissions cuts and monitoring action. A draft, more concise text of the deal should be available later on Thursday but it is expected to still be laden with brackets for wording to be decided on and gaps. Since last addressing a U.N. climate conference in 2009, Nasheed said he had been deposed in a coup, imprisoned and then forced into exile. “But almost 10 years since I was last at these climate negotiations, I must say, nothing much seems to have changed. We are still using the same old, dinosaur language,” he said. “Carbon emissions are rising, rising and rising and all we seem to be doing is talking, talking and talking.”  Reporting by Nina Chestney and Bate Felix; Editing by Gareth Jones",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-climate-change-accord-maldives-idUSKBN1OC1QG?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=5c127b1a04d3011c062a027d&utm_source=inshorts,

""#KanganaRanaut & Action director #NickPowell ensured that they used artillery that were prevalent in 19th century. Staying true to Rani Laxmibai's weapons of choice, Ranaut - apart from sword fighting - used caplock pistols (a small one-shot handgun) & Brown Bess cavalry carbine.

38323,Regulators in California considering tax on texting,"State regulators in California, US are considering charging a tax on texting services to help support public programs that make phone services accessible to the poor. As per the plan, the tax would be charged as a flat fee in monthly user bills. Texting services use the same infrastructure as voice calling, which was earlier liable for taxation.",Engadget,"Cell phone owners in California could soon pay extra for the privilege of sending text messages, thanks to landline-era legislation and changing usage patterns. According to recent public law filings, the state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) is considering a plan that would bill users a monthly fee for any text message services they use, and phone service carriers aren't happy about it.It all harks back to the so-called landline era of the 90s, when the US federal government and states established Public Purpose Programs (PPP), which charged all phone users a surcharge that supported programs for low earners (the same deal applies to other utilities, such as electricity). As the internet took off, though, the industry managed to get an exemption for what it dubbed ""information services,"" such as email and web-browsing. On Wednesday, the FCC approved a new rule that clarifies that text messages fall under this term.But because people use their phones for voice calling a great deal less now, revenues for PPP have fallen by around a third. The budget for subsidizing low earners, however, has risen by almost 50 percent. The PUC reckons that by including texts within the PPP (which would be convenient, as texting shares the same infrastructure as voice calling), it could raise $44.5 million a year.The exact structure of the charge would vary between carriers, who aren't exactly enthusiastic about the proposal. The commission will vote on the measure on January 10 next year, and is facing strong opposition from industry trade groups such as the CTIA, which represents AT&T Mobility, Sprint and T-Mobile. According to the CTIA, the proposal would go against federal law.The commission will also need to consider how other messaging services factor into its decision. Apps such as WhatsApp and iMessage, which already account for the lion's share of messaging traffic, would be exempt from the charge. In its filing, the CTIA argues that subjecting wireless carriers to charges that can't be applied to these services is ""illogical, anticompetitive, and harmful to consumers."" And of course, there's always the risk that applying such a charge will push consumers away from traditional SMS altogether, which would certainly impact the PUC's estimated $44.5 million figure, and subsequently the people the charge is meant to help in the first place.",https://www.engadget.com/2018/12/13/california-texting-tax/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,

38325,Biotech firm Zymergen raises $400 mn from SoftBank,"US-based biotech firm Zymergen on Thursday announced that it raised $400 million in a Series C funding round led by SoftBank Vision Fund. Goldman Sachs and Hanwha Asset Management, as well as existing investors including True Ventures, participated in the round. Founded in 2013, Zymergen integrates machine learning with genomics for use in pharmaceutical, chemical and agriculture industries.",TechCrunch,"Zymergen, a five-year-old company that manufacturers molecules for a wide array of uses and industries, has closed on $400 million in Series C funding led by one of its earlier investors, the SoftBank Vision Fund.Even in a world where triple-digit million-dollar rounds have become de rigueur, the amount stands out, as does the company, which occupies a 301,000-square-foot campus in Emeryville, Calif. and has been growing like gangbusters. How? By engineering yeast and bacterial strains for outfits across the pharmaceutical, food and agricultural, specialty chemical and electronics industries.Its objective is typically the same: to engineer tiny microbes with the aid of advanced computing to help increase the yields from these customers’ fermentation processes — and fatten their bottom lines in the process. Zymergen  doesn’t care if it’s an antibiotic they want to make, an alternate feedstock or even flexible OLEDs — the kind that Apple uses to produce its screen technology.In fact, Zymergen co-founder and CEO Joshua Hoffman says one of the biggest opportunities before his now 600-person company is to produce entirely new products that are untethered to traditional petroleum-based manufacturing, which currently underpins nearly everything we use and own, from gas to golf bags, from dishwasher parts to dresses.As it relates to OLEDs, for example, Hoffman notes that “current petrochemical-derived films don’t work as well as they should. They’re too blue, or they scratch, or they de-laminate and the screen comes apart. The problems are rooted in their core chemistry. But biology gives you the whole palette with which to create films, adhesives and coatings.”Zymergen never names its customers, except to say they are “Fortune 50” to “Fortune 500” companies. In an interview yesterday, Hoffman said he was not at liberty to disclose the specific products that Zymergen has helped to create either, offering only that its “partners have sold half a billion dollars worth of products made with our bugs in the last couple of years.”Added Hoffman, “Roughly 70 percent of the things that we find are in parts of the genome that humans don’t understand.”Indeed, Zymergen — whose number of customers is also a closely guarded secret  — attributes most of those findings to robotics that help eliminate human error and to machine learning that helps find more advanced patterns. Hoffman even argues that it would be hard for another outfit to effectively compete with it at this point because it’s “too hard to replicate the data sets” that Zymergen has created.Yet it does have competitors. Among them is nine-year-old Ginkgo Bioworks, which similarly designs, engineers, develops, tests and licenses organisms for use in sweeteners, cosmetic ingredients, crop treatments and pharmaceuticals, among other things. And Gingko has raised substantial funding of its own — roughly $430 million to date, including from Viking Global Investors, General Atlantic and Bill Gates.Of course, both are longer-term bets on the future, even while their respective investors are betting that one will be the bigger breakout company over time. For his part, Rohit Sharma, a partner with the early-stage firm True Ventures,  has his money on Zymergen. True was among the first institutional investors to invest in the company in 2014, and during a call yesterday, Sharma, who has sat on the board ever since, gushed about what it has managed to build since. “This is easily one of the most promising companies I’ve worked with,” he said. “This isn’t engineering eyeballs or daily active users or manipulating business models. This is innovation on the scale of the way the chemical industry came into existence and grew to a $3 trillion-plus industry. Zymergen will still be very relevant in 20 years.”In the meantime, the company, which had closed its previous round with $130 million in 2016, is starting to see meaningful revenue, suggests Hoffman. Though Zymergen structures its deals differently depending on the customer, in all cases, it charges a subscription fee for its product and a share of the value that it creates.Other investors in Zymergen’s newest round include Goldman Sachs and Hanwha Asset Management, as well as earlier investors DCVC, True, Two Sigma Ventures, DFJ and Innovation Endeavors. The capital, says Hoffman, will be used to reach more customers and invest more in its platform.“It’s a boatload of money,” he volunteers. But he says the company was “able to raise it because we’re showing commercial traction and technology traction. This differentiated way of thinking about biology really works.”",https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/13/zymergen-lands-400-million-more-for-its-genetically-altered-microbes-led-by-softbank-vision-fund/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,

The team trained a computer to recognise 10,000 transparent glass-like etchings, based on extremely grainy, low-light images of those patterns. The computer was then able to reconstruct the transparent object from a new dark image.",Engadget,"You might not see most objects in near-total darkness, but AI can.  MIT scientists have developed a technique that uses a deep neural network to spot objects in extremely low light.  The team trained the network to look for transparent patterns in dark images by feeding it 10,000 purposefully dark, grainy and out-of-focus pictures as well as the patterns those pictures are supposed to represent.  The strategy not only gave the neural network an idea of what to expect, but highlighted hidden transparent objects by producing ripples in what little light was present.The researchers countered the blurring by giving it a physics lesson -- it knew how a defocused camera could produce blurring effects.The result was an AI-based system that could find and reproduce hidden objects in lighting conditions would make even a dark room seem bright.  That could help for nighttime photography, but the MIT research group is most interested in using the technology for medicine.  It's normally hard to capture minute details in biological material without flooding them with light and radiation, risking damage to those tissues.  This could avoid the problem by imaging tissues at much lower (and thus safer) light levels.  It could help for astronomy, too, by detecting very faint objects without illumination.",https://www.engadget.com/2018/12/12/ai-reveals-hidden-objects-in-the-dark/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,

On Tuesday, a court sentenced him to seven years in jail as well as six strokes of the cane for his crime. As per reports, the accused, identified as Jayselan N Chandrasegar, lost his temper after he spotted his pregnant wife – who used to be a sex worker – talking to a man at a market. Assuming that the man was a pimp, the accused flew into a rage and assaulted his wife, Mayuri Krishnakumar. He stabbed her abdomen twice with a 10-cm blade and also slashed her back and the fled from the spot. The court was informed on Tuesday that the unborn baby was unharmed in the attack, PTI reported. On Tuesday, 30-year-old Jayselan pleaded guilty to one count of causing grievous hurt to his 27-year-old wife with a weapon and also to another unrelated crime of failing to provide his urine sample after he was apprehended for suspected drug-related offences in a previous incident. The couple, who got married in 2013, was going through marital problems owing to financial issues and their older child, who was three-years-old at that time, the prosecutor told. The court was informed by Deputy Public Prosecutor (DPP) Houston Johannus that when Mayuri told Jayselan that she was pregnant, he accused her of infidelity. After their quarrels escalated, Mayuri left his house and went to live with her friends, most of whom were also sex workers, and lived in “red light” area.On December 30, at 11 am Mayuri had gone to the market to buy breakfast when she came across an old friend and started talking to him. However, Jayselan, who was in the area, saw the two talking and assumed that his wife had become a sex worker again. Enraged, he confronted the duo and then attacked his wife, the prosecutor told. Jayselan was arrested later that day after a passerby informed the police.

Akshay had allegedly facilitated the meeting to get his 2015 film 'Singh is Bliing' cleared. The meeting was allegedly held before the Dera chief was pardoned in a blasphemy case.,The Quint,"Bollywood actor Akshay Kumar was quizzed for nearly two hours on Wednesday, 21 November, by the Special Investigation Team in Chandigarh. He was questioned for his role in 2015 Bargari sacrilege row in Punjab. Kumar was summoned by the SIT probing the police firing on mobs protesting the 2015 incidents of desecration of Guru Granth Sahib.The actor denied all charges against him, including charges of arranging a meeting between former Deputy Chief Minister Sukhbir Singh Badal and Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh, reported News18.According to a report by Hindustan Times, the special investigation team is now examining Bollywood star Akshay Kumar’s purported role in greasing the wheels in terms of a reported meeting between Dera Sacha Sauda head Gurmeet Ram Rahim and Akali Dal chief Sukhbir Badal, with regard to the release of his film, Singh is Bliing.According to the reports by News18, 42 questions were earlier put to Kumar in a questioning by SIT, spanning for nearly two hours.Denying all charges sternly, Kumar clarified that he was busy with the shooting of his movies Gabbar is Back and Baby.“I have never met Sukhbir Singh Badal outside Punjab. It’s being said that the meeting happened at my home in 2015 but at that time I was busy shooting for movies Baby and Gabbar is Back,” the statement submitted by Akshay Kumar read, reported News18.He has reportedly told the SIT that his name has been dragged into the row unnecessarily, News18 reported.The actor has also denied the allegation that he arranged the meeting between former deputy CM and Dera chief Ram Rahim.

38352,Apple to build new $1 billion campus in US' Texas,"Apple on Thursday announced that it is investing $1 billion to build a new campus in Austin, Texas. The 133-acre campus will accommodate an initial 5,000 employees, with a total capacity of 15,000 employees. Apple will also invest $10 billion in data centres as part of a five-year investment aimed at creating 20,000 jobs in the US.",Reuters,"(Reuters) - Apple Inc said on Thursday it would spend $1 billion to build a second campus in Austin, Texas, that will house up to 15,000 workers as part of a broader push by U.S. companies to create more domestic jobs. The iPhone maker also said it plans to expand in Seattle, San Diego and Culver City, California, and add hundreds of jobs in Pittsburgh, New York and Boulder, Colorado, over the next three years. Apple said at the start of the year it would invest $30 billion in the United States, taking advantage of a windfall from U.S. President Donald Trump’s sweeping tax code overhaul. The 133-acre campus in Austin will be less than a mile from Apple’s existing facilities and initially have 5,000 employees. The jobs created would be in engineering, research and development, operations and finance. Amazon.com Inc in November said it will create more than 25,000 jobs in both New York and the Washington, D.C. area by opening massive new offices. The two technology companies chose cities with a wealth of white-collar workers and high employment, bypassing other regions that may have required more investment. Austin is one of the fastest-growing U.S. cities with a population of nearly 1 million, and is home to the University of Texas and other tech companies including Dell Technologies Inc in nearby Round Rock, Texas, and IBM.  Apple’s existing facility in north Austin has more than 6,000 workers, the most outside its headquarters in Cupertino, California. With the new campus, the company will become the largest private employer in the city. “Apple has been a vital part of the Austin community for a quarter century, and we are thrilled that they are deepening their investment,” Austin Mayor Steve Adler said on Thursday. Corporate America has been under political pressure to ramp up investments at home as part of Trump’s “America First” policies, which have led to a bitter trade war with China. Trump has also warned of possible tariffs on iPhones and other Apple products imported from China. It is in the interest of U.S. companies to tout job creation because those that move positions overseas or shutter factories have drawn sharp rebukes from Trump, who has championed job creation. Most recently, the president said he told General Motors Co Chief Executive Mary Barra he was unhappy with her decision to cut production at an Ohio factory. The new Austin campus marks a turnabout from Chief Executive Tim Cook’s earlier comments that Texas would be an unlikely choice for a new campus. “Apple is proud to bring new investment, jobs and opportunity to cities across the United States and to significantly deepen our quarter-century partnership with the city and people of Austin,” Cook said. Apple could be getting some incentives for the Austin expansion in the form of a $25 million grant from the Texas Enterprise Fund, a source familiar with the matter said.  The fund awards “deal closing grants” to companies looking at new projects in Texas, according to its web site. The Austin American-Statesman newspaper reported that Apple is also seeking a 15-year property tax abatement for the new campus and said the city did not provide incentives.  Unlike tech rival Amazon, Apple did not hold a public bidding process to choose the site of its new campus.  Amazon last month ended a more than year-long bidding war for a $5 billion second headquarters, splitting that investment between Long Island City in Queens, New York, and Arlington, Virginia, for offices that could each house 25,000 jobs. Amazon’s plans for its New York City headquarters met with backlash from some city officials and state representatives due to the project’s large tax breaks and potential impact on the neighborhood’s infrastructure. Last year, Apple moved into its sleek “spaceship” campus in Cupertino that cost about $5 billion. The company has added 6,000 U.S. jobs this year and is on track to reach the goal it set out in January of adding 20,000 domestic jobs by 2023. Shares of Apple rose 1.3 percent to $171.43 in midday trading. They have tumbled more than 20 percent since Nov. 1, when Apple warned sales for the crucial holiday quarter would likely miss Wall Street expectations.

BJP's Meenakshi Lekhi raised the issue of rape of women by their acquaintances and demanded a speedy trial in these cases.Only Adsul and Lekhi got an opportunity to speak in the House which saw members of the AIADMK, TDP and Congress raise slogans in support of their demands. As the protests continued, Speaker Sumitra Mahajan asked members to allow the House to function but in vain. The House was then adjourned for the day.Earlier as soon as the Question Hour began after paying tributes to martyrs of the 2001 Parliament attack, members from the Congress, TDP and AIADMK rushed to the Well raising slogans, following which the Speaker adjourned the House.TDP member Venkateshwara Rao (Babu) used a mike installed in the Well for the oath of a new member to prop up a poster seeking special status for Andhra Pradesh. A Lok Sabha secretariat staffer tried to convince him not to use the mike. Parliamentary Affairs Minister Narendra Singh Tomar too tried to convince him to keep down the mike.The TDP member's action invited the ire of Speaker Sumitra Mahajan who warned him that he will be named. Once a member is named, he or she has to leave the House chamber. The Speaker then adjourned the House for nearly 10 minutes till 11.20 AM.When the House assembled again, Mahajan reminded members that they can raise issues under various rules. Apparently referring to the Lok Sabha polls due in 2019, she said it was a ""crucial time"" and members should use it to raise issues related to the public.She said Lok Sabha is for all states and regions and all should get a chance to raise their respective issues.
But opposition members remained unconvinced and returned to the Well. As the bedlam continued, the House was adjourned for nearly 30 minutes till noon. ",https://www.timesnownews.com/india/article/rafale-deal-cauvery-river-water-issues-rock-parliament-lok-sabha-adjourned-for-the-day/330399?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,

They (Bharatiya Janata Party) have created hatred in the last four-and-half years and are trying to break this country and this country will soon get weak.”Comparing the BJP with the British, the former chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir said, “They (Bharatiya Janata Party) are like the British who divided and ruled India and this government is also following the same footprints. There is also a possibility that the Indian Army may soon also get divided on the basis of religious lines and become a victim of communalisation.”",https://www.india.com/news/india/farooq-abdullah-reacts-to-meghalaya-hc-judges-remark-says-india-a-secular-nation-will-remain-so-3476968/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,

We’re talking about extremism and terrorism.A new law was introduced in Russia this October that obliges all operators of search engines to exclude terrorist, extremist and other illegal websites from their search results.To do so, they should link up with a database of around 120,000 banned URLs, compiled by the Russian authorities.However, Google refuses to filter the illegal content, despite Roskomnadzor holding several meetings with the representatives of the US tech giant and explaining the legalities to them.In September, the watchdog also threated to block Facebook in Russia as the company violated the bans on storing of Russian citizens’ personal data on servers located outside the country.Think your friends would be interested?

""Falsifying Moon soil is impossible,"" he added. This comes after Roscosmos chief Dmitry Rogozin in November announced Russia will launch a mission to verify US' Moon landings.",RT,"The claim that NASA never landed astronauts on the moon and that evidence to the contrary was fabricated is among the most pervasive in popular culture and has been a point of fierce debates.Dmitry Rogozin, Russia’s space chief, even recently joked that Russia’s future lunar missions will give the country an opportunity to check whether Neil Armstrong’s footprints are actually out there.That aside, people who actually study the moon for a living believe there is no need to launch spaceships just to prove the success of the Apollo program. Fabricating a lunar landing would probably be technologically impossible and anyway economically unnecessary, told RIA Novosti Yury Kostitsyn.The man heads the Institute of Analytical Chemistry, which is directly involved in developing sensors for space and was part of the Soviet robotic study of the moon.“Faking the landing of the American astronauts to the Moon would have been more complex and expensive than actually doing it,” the scientist assured.The key piece of evidence in his own field of knowledge is the moon soil, which the Americans retrieved. It was studied in labs of many countries, including the USSR, and it’s definitely not from this planet.“Falsifying moon soil is impossible. The Americans brought back to Earth about 300 kilos of it, most of it basalt,” he explained.“We have basalts on Earth too, but they are significantly different from the lunar ones in their chemical composition, properties, and structure. There are no rock formations older than 3.7 billion years, and what the Americans brought is over 4 billion years old, comparable to the age of the solar system.” (NB. There are actually rocks of earth origin dated over 4bn years, but the ones brought from the Moon are still older.)READ MORE: Russia, China agree joint data center for lunar projects & deep space exploration“There is nothing to argue about Americans landing on the moon between 1969 and 1972,” Kostitsyn stressed. “You won’t hear a single cosmonaut say they didn’t.”That aside, more secrets of our closest ‘neighbor’ could be discovered soon after China blasted off a lunar rover on a historic mission to explore the far side of the moon. Earlier this year Russian space agency Roscosmos also announced that Moscow and Beijing have agreed to create a joint data center for lunar and deep space projects.In 2016, Russian space rocket giant Energia announced plans to create a reusable space vehicle to shuttle cargo and crews between the Space Station and the moon. Like this story?

""It should've been '281 and beyond and that saved Sourav Ganguly's career'. I strongly opposed it because if he hadn't scored 281, we would've lost...I wouldn't have been captain again,"" he added.",CricTracker,"Former Indian cricketer Sourav Ganguly is regarded as one of the finest captains to have ever led the Indian cricket team. Under his leadership, the team flourished big time, and registered several historic wins. Among the biggest wins that the Indian team registered under his captaincy was the iconic Eden Garden Test against Australia in 2001.India had beaten Australia after having been asked to follow-on in the match. The chief architects of the Indian win were VVS Laxman and Rahul Dravid. Laxman, in particular, was termed as the national hero for his remarkable unbeaten 281. Recently, VVS Laxman launched his book titled on the same lines, “281 and beyond”. At the book launch, Sourav Ganguly remarked that he did not like the title of the book. He insisted that Laxman should have added that the 281 saved him from being axed as the captain.Advertisement“I also texted him a month back but he didn’t reply. I told him it was not the apt title… It should have been ‘281 and beyond and that saved Sourav Ganguly’s career’. I strongly opposed the title because if he had not scored 281, we would have lost the Test and I would not have been captain again,” Sourav Ganguly quoted as per the quotes in Times of India.While Laxman was indeed in good form during the time, it was surprising to see him getting dropped from the Indian squad for 2003 World Cup. Commenting on the same, Ganguly mentioned that it was perhaps a mistake in the hindsight.“Laxman was a player who could have done well in all formats. In hindsight, maybe it was a mistake. As a captain, you take decisions and things happen which may not be right or wrong,” Ganguly remarked.On a similar note, Laxman remarked that he indeed felt devastated not being named in the squad back then. He, however, was quick to realise his love for the sport and knew that a World Cup will not justify the love he has for the lovely game.“I realised, that I did not become a cricketer to play the World Cup but it was for the sport. I was being childish. I told myself ‘I was among the lucky few who got this opportunity and I should not let it go’,” Laxman recalled.",https://www.crictracker.com/sourav-ganguly-recalls-the-incident-that-saved-his-captaincy-career/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,
38419,ICC persuading government to make fixing criminal offence: ICC CEO,"The International Cricket Council (ICC) is constantly persuading governments, including India's, to make fixing a criminal offence, ICC CEO Dave Richardson has said. ""The Anti-Corruption Unit is trying to be much more pro-active,"" he added. This comes after former Sri Lankan cricketers Sanath Jayasuriya and Nuwan Zoysa were charged under the ICC Anti-Corruption Code.",Cricket Country,"The International Cricket Council (ICC) is constantly persuading governments, including India’s, to make fixing a criminal offence, said its CEO Dave Richardson on Wednesday in the wake of “serious” corruption allegations that has hit the sport in Sri Lanka.Three Sri Lankan cricketers including Sanath Jayasuriya and Nuwan Zoysa have been charged recently under the ICC Anti-Corruption Code.Jayasuriya, however, has been charged only for failing to co-operate with an ICC investigation, a claim that the former opener has denied.With ever increasing threat of corruption in the game, Richarson said the ICC’s Anti-Corruption Unit (ACU) has gone on an overdrive to curb the menace.“Most of our efforts now are on disrupting the criminals and this means persuading governments to introduce legislation that can make attempts to fix cricket matches a criminal offence, so that those types of people are put behind bars,” said Richardson at a promotional event.“The ACU is trying to be much more pro-active. First of all, in disrupting these criminals who are travelling the world trying to corrupt the game.“We are also getting much better intelligence on who these people are and we have been able to do that only because more players are reporting the approaches to us,” said the ICC boss, who will step down from his post after the 2019 World Cup.The ICC recently suspended former Sri Lanka allrounder Dilhara Lokuhettige after charging him with match fixing during the T10 League in UAE last year.The second edition of the T10 League had ICC’s approval and Richardson insisted that due diligence was followed before the governing body gave the tournament its thumbs-up.“Whether it is T10 of any other league, we will have a much more robust system in place before these leagues are approved.”He is confident that the World Cup in England next year will be corruption free. “We have a full team working with law enforcement agencies in the UK. We are very confident that we can keep the World Cup corruption free.”Talking about the BCCI’s reluctance to support ICC in taking the sport to the 2028 Olympics, the South African said the issue will be resolved soon. “Yes, we have our ambitions to have cricket in the Olympics. That is easier said than done. We need to convince the IOC for that,” he said. “103 out of 104 members (barring BCCI) were strongly behind the decision to get cricket into the Olympics.“There are some issues the BCCI has with the IOA (Indian Olympic Association) but I am very confident that those issues can be resolved.”The World Anti-Doping Agency can make the ICC non-complaint for failing to convince the BCCI to come under the umbrella of its Indian affiliate NADA. The BCCI as of now gets its cricketers tested from a private dope testing agency.“The ICC is facilitating discussions with WADA and BCCI. I know that there is a willingness on the part of the BCCI to resolve the situation with the IOA. It is not as if BCCI doesn’t want to do testing, they are doing testing. Their reluctance has only been to use this particular agency (NADA).”On the upcoming World Cup where all teams will be playing each other before the knock-outs, a first since the 1992 edition, Richardson said it will be one of the most competitive editions and the conditions will be in favour of the batsmen.“I think certainly the sense is that you don’t want to take the bowler completely out of the game but probably in 50 over format, if it is still going to favour anybody, it is going to be 60-40 in favour of the batsman.“We are talking anything between 230 and 280 as competitive scores. That is what we are trying to aim for. We want good batting wickets which give bowlers some chance,” he added.",https://www.cricketcountry.com/news/icc-persuading-governments-to-make-fixing-a-criminal-offence-dave-richardson-777418?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,

A court in London Monday ordered the extradition of Mallya, wanted in India for alleged financial irregularities.Responding to another claim of the defence, Singh said the application to declare the former MP a fugitive was filed before the court after all means to bring him back failed to yield any result. Despite the issuance of summonses and three NBWs (non-bailable warrants), Mallya refused to join the probe against him, the ED lawyer said.The extradition process is proof enough that he is not willing to return, he said. ""He is fighting not to come to India. Mallya claimed that he doesn't want to return as the case was 'politically motivated.

It is not a ""draconian"" law but just an Act to bring back a person to India to join probe and face trial for offences listed under it, Singh said.Singh said Mallya's lawyers, during their arguments and replies in the court on the ED application, have not said anything about his return to India. ""Neither during their reply or arguments, they have said anything. Even now (after the extradition order) he has not made any statement that when he is coming or how he is coming,"" the ED counsel added.Mallya, facing charges brought by the CBI and the ED, is wanted in India for alleged fraud and money laundering amounting to an estimated Rs 9,000 crore. ",https://www.timesnownews.com/business-economy/companies/article/who-goes-to-attend-a-meeting-with-300-bags-ed-asks-vijay-mallyas-lawyer/330061?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,

The funding round was led by investors including Singapores sovereign wealth fund GIC and China International Capital Corporation. Luckin Coffee was officially launched in January 2018 and has raised a total of $400 million to date.,TechCrunch,"Luckin, a startup that vows to topple Starbucks’  dominance in China, announced on Wednesday that it’s lifted its valuation to $2.2 billion after raising $200 million in a Series B funding round.This comes only five months after the coffee upstart, which soft-launched in January, picked up $200 million in investment. Luckin has been on a spending spree to open shops and burned through $150 million within the first six months in operation, its founder said in July when the company had a cash reserve of 2 billion yuan, or roughly $290 million.Luckin currently operates across 21 major Chinese cities, totaling more than 1,700 shops. For comparison, Starbucks’ footprint spanned 3,300 stores in China as of May, though one has to take into account that the Seattle coffee chain entered China nearly 20 years ago.Different from Starbucks, Luckin’s brick-and-mortar facilities are a mix of sit-down cafes and pickup booths, which double as delivery hubs, and take-out kitchens that are solely for delivery staff to pick up caffeine-infused orders and put them in customers’ hands within 30 minutes.As a result, Luckin managed to build a dense network targeting office workers who may be drawn to the idea of coffee delivery because they can’t leave their desk. There’s at least one Luckin location within a 500-meter radius anywhere in downtown Shanghai and Beijing, the company claimed.The speed at which Luckin has expanded in less than a year probably got on the nerves of Starbucks, which went on to team up with Alibaba-owned food delivery giant Ele.me in August to bring coffee to people’s doorstep. The American company aims to expand its delivery services to 30 cities in China by the end of 2018.Luckin’s co-founder and chief executive officer Qian Zhiya, who is the former chief operating officer at one of China’s largest auto rental firms (CAR Inc.), said her startup will continue to invest in products, technology and business development to improve user experience following the new round.Luckin raised the fresh capital from existing investors Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC,  Chinese government-controlled China International Capital Corporation, Joy Capital and Dazheng Capital. Liu Erhai, founding and managing partner of Joy Capital, joined Luckin’s board of directors following the close of the round. Liu’s investment portfolio includes Car Inc., Facebook’s old Chinese rival Renren and Hong Kong-listed game publisher iDreamsky.",https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/12/luckin-tops-2-billion-valuation/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,

Today, the startup operates five locations in the U.S., with ambitious plans to open another 100 female-focused co-working spaces by 2022.“I want The Riveter to be the place people think of when they think of women and work,” Nelson told TechCrunch.The Riveter  has 2,000 members throughout its locations in Seattle, Bellevue, Wash. and Los Angeles. Its expansion plans include new spots in Texas, Colorado and Portland.The spaces are built with women in mind but are not exclusive to one gender.

The left-handed batsman has smashed more than 11000 runs across all formats in international cricket. With 17 hundreds and 71 half-centuries to his name, Yuvraj is renowned for his aggressive batting in the middle order. It has been more than a year since he last represented India. He may not be in line for the upcoming World Cup but his contribution to Indian cricket is unmatchable.Regarded as one of the greatest limited overs batsmen that India has produced, Yuvraj was the Man of the Tournament in India’s World Cup winning campaign. The all-rounder scored 362 runs, took 15 wickets and won four Man of the Match awards. He also played an integral role in India’s WT20 triumph. His 70(30) propelled India to a victory against Australia in the semis. Yuvraj also hit six sixes to Stuart Broad in the same tournament which became a huge talking point then.AdvertisementOn the occasion of his birthday, all the cricketers right from Sourav Ganguly to Rohit Sharma showered their wishes. Harbhajan Singh with whom he has played since his Punjab days had a special wish for the cricketer. Alongside some Punjabi slangs, the off-spinner also posted some amazing pictures with him. Virender Sehwag also shared a picture of both of them sharing a laugh.Yuvraj has fought battles not only inside the field but outside too. The cricketer was diagnosed with cancer just after the 2011 World Cup. He fought against it and came back to represent India again. Sachin Tendulkar highlighted the same as he wished the cricketer alongside a candid picture.

38447,Dhoni must play domestic cricket for India selection: Amarnath,"World Cup-winning former Indian cricketer Mohinder Amarnath has said ex-India captain MS Dhoni and other senior players must play domestic cricket to be eligible for Team India selection. ""I think (BCCI) should change their policy altogether. A lot of senior players don't play domestic cricket,"" he added. Dhoni hasn't played a professional cricket match since November 1.",Cricket Country,"Former India allrounder and selector Mohinder Amarnath feels MS Dhoni and other senior players must play domestic cricket to be eligible for selection in the national team.ALSO READ: Kohli engineered Kumble’s exit, leaked email suggestsHaving being dropped from the Twenty20 side recently and retired from Tests long ago, Dhoni now is a certainty in only ODI cricket.Despite having the time, the former captain did not play the 50-over Vijay Hazare Trophy this year and will go into the three-match series in Australia next month without any match practice.“Every individual is different but one thing I have always believed in is that if you want to play for India you have to play for your state as well. I think they (BCCI) should change this policy altogether. A lot of senior players don’t play domestic cricket,” Amarnath told PTI on sidelines of an event.Legendary opener Sunil Gavaskar had suggested the same recently.Shikhar Dhawan is another senior player who is not playing the ongoing Ranji Trophy despite being dropped from the Test team.“The BCCI should make it an eligibility criteria. Not only a number of games, you should be playing regularly for your state if you are not playing for India and not only just before the India selection. Then only you can judge how good the guy is playing. Whatever you have achieved is all in the past. What is important is current form,” said the hero of India’s World Cup triumph in 1983.“Even if you are playing one format, you should be playing all formats at least in domestic cricket to be considered for selection,” the former selector said.Talking about the ongoing Test series in Australia, Amarnath said India are a superior unit but the depleted hosts are capable of giving them a run for their money even in the absence of suspended Steve Smith and David Warner.“Australian cricketers think differently. It is not the first time they are going through this kind of phase. At the time of Kerry Packer series, they lost their top players, they toured South Africa without their top players and now they don’t have their top two players and some of the guys have retired.“They are in the process of building a new team. But from what I watched in the first Test, some of the players are really good. You can’t just rule Australia out of the series. Of course India are more superior but again they have to continue playing good cricket.“First Test was a fantastic Test match from a cricketing point of view. The only difference was Cheteshwar Pujara. It shows we are here for a thrilling series with advantage India,” said the 68-year-old, who played 69 Tests and 85 ODIs.How will India do in the second Test starting Friday in Perth? “It depends on nature of wicket. If the wicket is doing a bit, some of the batsmen struggle with their technique. It is not how aggressive you play, the key in Test cricket is that only when you leave good deliveries, you occupy the crease for a long time. It is not that they don’t have that in them but they have to adapt.”Amarnath’s longtime teammate Syed Kirmani had recently said the current selection panel headed by MSK Prasad was not experienced enough to challenge the decisions of captain Virat Kohli and coach Ravi Shastri.The five-member panel is low on international playing experience with chief Prasad having played six Tests and 17 ODIs. The other four — Sarandeep Singh (2 Tests, 5 ODIs), Devang Gandhi (4 Tests, 3 ODIs), Jatin Paranjpe (4 ODIs) and Gagan Khoda (2 ODIs) — too do not have enough experience in top-fight.Amarnath said you have to be an ‘achiever’ to gain the respect of the players. “It is not about experience (as a selector). You are selected to do a job because you are good enough for that. But definitely if you are an achiever you think differently, if you are a non-achiever, definitely you cannot take decisions at times,” he said.",https://www.cricketcountry.com/news/ms-dhoni-must-play-domestic-cricket-for-india-selection-mohinder-amarnath-777373?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,

38449,Kerala engineer finds bug that made 400mn Microsoft emails hackable,"A Kerala-based application security engineer named Sahad Nk has won a bug bounty from Microsoft for discovering a bug that left over 400 million Microsoft accounts, including Office 365 and Outlook emails, open to hacking. Sahad reported the bug to Microsoft, which fixed the vulnerability. ""The Microsoft Security Response Center mitigated the case in November 2018,"" a Microsoft spokesperson said.",TechCrunch,"A string of bugs when chained together created the perfect attack to gain access to someone’s Microsoft  account — simply by tricking a user into clicking a link.Sahad Nk, an India-based bug hunter, discovered that a Microsoft subdomain, “success.office.com,” had not been properly configured, allowing him to take it over. He used a CNAME record, a canonical record used to link one domain to another, to point the unconfigured subdomain to his own Azure instance. In doing so, he controlled the subdomain — and any data sent to it, he said in a write-up shared with TechCrunch prior to publication.That wouldn’t be much of a problem on its own, but Nk also found that Microsoft Office, Store and Sway apps could be tricked into sending their authenticated login tokens to his newly controlled domain after a user logs in through Microsoft’s Live login system.That’s because the vulnerable apps use a wildcard regex, allowing all office.com — including his newly controlled subdomain — to be trusted.Once the victim clicks on a specially crafted link sent in an email, for example, the user will log in through Microsoft’s login system using their username and password — and two-factor code, if set up — which creates an account access token to keep the user logged in without having to enter their password again and again. Obtaining an account access token is the equivalent of having someone’s credentials — and allows an attacker to break into that user’s account seamlessly, often without raising any alarms or triggering any warnings. (They’re the same kind of account tokens that put more than 30 million Facebook accounts at risk earlier this year.)But the malicious URL is crafted in a way that instructs Microsoft’s login system to pass the account token to Nk’s controlled subdomain — which, if it were controlled by a malicious attacker, could have put countless accounts at risk. Worst of all, the malicious URL looks legitimate — because the user still logs in through Microsoft’s systems, and the “wreply” parameter in the URL also doesn’t look suspect because it’s an Office subdomain.In other words: Anyone’s Office account — even enterprise and corporate accounts, including their email, documents and other files, could have been easily accessed by a malicious attacker — and it would have been near-impossible to discern from a legitimate user.Nk, with the help of Paulos Yibelo, reported the bug to Microsoft, which fixed the vulnerability.“The Microsoft Security Response Center mitigated the case in November 2018,” a Microsoft spokesperson confirmed in an email to TechCrunch. The bug was remediated by removing the CNAME record pointing to Nk’s Azure instance, he explained.Microsoft paid out a bug bounty for Nk’s efforts.Gift Guide: The best security and privacy tech to keep your friends safe",https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/11/microsoft-login-bug-hijack-office-accounts/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,

The deceased had committed suicide on Tuesday and was brought to the hospital for post-mortem. ""It was a quality issue...we've spoken to the freezer's contractors,"" hospital's Chief Medical Officer said.",The News Minute,"In a disturbing incident at Kamaraj Government Hospital in Chidambaram, a rat bit off the nose of a dead body which was being kept in a damaged freezer at the hospital's mortuary. It was the second incident in recent months that highlighted poor conditions in government healthcare.The deceased, identified as 22-year-old Vaitheeswaran who was a native of Thandeshwaranallur village near Chidambaram, had killed himself on Tuesday. His body was taken to the government hospital for the post-mortem, and the body was left overnight in the mortuary. In the morning, friends of the deceased saw his body and were shocked to find that his nose had been bitten off.When TNM first spoke to hospital officials, they denied the incident had occurred. But on further probing, they revealed some details regarding the mortuary and the conditions in which the body was stored. “There was an issue with the freezer in which the body was kept, there was some small hole through which the rat has gone inside,” said Dr Tamilarasan, Chief Medical Officer (CMO) of Chidambaram Government Hospital. “It was a quality issue and we have spoken to the contractors of the freezer to get them to fix the issue so that nothing like this happens again.”However, when asked why the hospital premises was poorly maintained, he said, “This is a rural area, and it’s a big space, there’s only so much that can be done to maintain this,” added the CMO.In a similarly disturbing incident which took place at Coimbatore Government Hospital in November, a video shows a woman exposed and crumpled on the floor of the hospital, while a cat seems to lick a wound on her leg. Videos and images of the incident were circulated by the patients and attenders nearby, though the hospital claimed that the images didn’t show the full story and denied the allegations.",https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/rat-bites-dead-mans-nose-tn-government-hospital-93253?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,

The actor is currently busy with the promotions of his upcoming film which also stars Anushka Sharma and Katrina Kaif in the lead roles. This year has been very special for the superstar as his daughter Suhana Khan made her magazine debut on the Vogue cover. While many loved it, some even bashed it asking why is she on the cover when she isn't even doing any film currently. The question of what his children - Aryan Khan and Suhana Khan and also little AbRam will be pursuing as a career is always being asked to Khan.In an interview with Mumbai Mirror, Shah Rukh was asked the same question. SRK said that neither his son nor his daughter is groomed to be actors. While Suhana has an inclination towards being an actor, SRK said that after finishing her school in six months she will go to an education institute to get trained in acting. There have been several reports about who will launch SRK's elder son Aryan. But the actor revealed that his son doens't want to become an actor. The Dilwale actor said, "" Aryan doesn't want to be an actor, he wants to make films, become a director, and is training for it in the US.""He added, ""AbRam, I don't know, he's good-looking enough to be a rock star.""Well, this means Aryan Khan might not be seen on screen in films if direction is his focus.So looks Boney and Khushi's desperate attempts at setting up her debut opposite Aryan Khan didn't work.thank goodnessAryan khan will be a super star, in front of the camera !He can manage his fathers business. He’ll be able to live a comfortable life anywayWish his daughter had taken this decision!It's not about mere good looks for the men ,it's more about the on screen charisma and how convincing they are in front of the camera. Reminds me of the time when Rajesh Khanna marked out the admittedly attractive Vijay Arora (of Yadoon ki baraat fame) to replace him whereas it was an average looking man with the Voice called Amitabh Bachchan who won. Aryan is very young right now and may well change his mind when he's older , the going won't be easy for him & he will be in Jhanvi Kapoor's shoes.His first and second child should not try to be actors. Youngest one is really cute.Aryan looks very realistic and sensible.Good for him. Too smug to face the camera.Aryan is so handsome! He should become an actor.Aryan is born to be an actor.. Ranveer Singh h does not have chocolate boy looks but he is # 1 actor,You dont need to be goodlooking anymore to be an actor.. But Aryan is good;lookingI knew it.

38460,Ram temple issue may not benefit BJP in 2019 polls: Pawar,Nationalist Congress Party President Sharad Pawar on Wednesday said the Ram temple issue might not benefit the BJP if it is raised ahead of 2019 Lok Sabha elections. His comment came a day after the BJP lost Assembly elections in three states where it was in power. He also said that people do not accept an issue twice.,Times Now,"Mumbai; A day after the BJP's poll debacle in three Hindi heartland states, NCP chief Sharad Pawar Wednesday said the Ram temple issue might not work in favour of the saffron party again, unlike in the past, if it is raised ahead of 2019 Lok Sabha polls. He alleged that the BJP may try to create a communal divide on the temple issue which is a ""matter of concern"". The BJP is under pressure from its ideological mentor RSS, alliance partner Shiv Sena and Hindutva organisations which are demanding a parliamentary law or an ordinance for construction of Ram temple.Sena MPs on Wednesday staged a protest in the Lok Sabha demanding immediate construction of the temple. ""The issue of Ram temple was used once in the past and the BJP stood benefited by it. In case they (the BJP) raise the issue again, people do not accept an issue twice... So, I don't think it (Ram temple) will benefit them (the BJP),"" Pawar said.The veteran politician was speaking to reporters after meeting scores of party workers who had gathered here to greet him on his 78th birthday. The BJP, which was in power in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh since the last 15 years, lost to the Congress in the assembly polls, results for which were announced Tuesday. The Congress also looks set to form a government in Rajasthan, ruled by the saffron party until now.Stating that people do not accept the same issue twice, Pawar referred to the general elections held post Emergency and the assembly polls held in Maharashtra over the issue of 'Samyukta (joint) Maharashtra' in the 1950s and 1960s.He said Indira Gandhi-led Congress had to taste defeat in the 1977 Lok Sabha polls which was held after imposition of Emergency. The Janata alliance of parties, opposed to the ruling Congress party, had won that elections riding on the anti-Congress wave. ""But that issue (Emergency) did not appeal to the people when the (Lok Sabha) elections were held again (in 1980),"" he noted.Pawar also recalled the Congress was defeated in Maharashtra in 1955-56 Assembly polls over the issue of the Samyukta Maharashtra. ""But in the 1962 Assembly polls, the Congress came back to power as people did not accept the Samyukta Maharashtra issue,"" he added.In his annual Vijaya Dashmi rally held in Nagpur this October, RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat had demanded a law to pave the way for construction of the temple on the disputed site in Ayodhya.Many Hindu organisations have been demanding the construction of the temple, as promised by the BJP before coming to power in 2014.
The BJP has been saying that it was committed to the construction of the temple but is silent on bringing an ordinance in Parliament for the purpose. The matter of Ayodhya title suits is currently pending in the Supreme Court. ",https://www.timesnownews.com/india/article/ram-temple-issue-may-not-click-for-bjp-in-lok-sabha-elections-2019-ncp-chief-sharad-pawar/330103?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,
38461,Indonesian e-commerce giant Tokopedia raises $1.1 bn funding,"Indonesias largest online marketplace Tokopedia on Wednesday announced it had secured $1.1 billion in a funding round led by SoftBank Vision Fund and Alibaba Group. SoftBank Ventures Korea and other existing investors also participated in the deal that reportedly valued Tokopedia at $7 billion. William Tanuwijaya, the 37-year-old son of a factory worker, co-founded Tokopedia in 2009.",TechCrunch,"Indonesia-based e-commerce firm Tokopedia is the latest startup to enter the Vision Fund after it raised a $1.1 billion Series G round led by the SoftBank megafund and Alibaba.SoftBank  and Alibaba are existing investors in the business — the Chinese e-commerce giant led a $1.1 billion round last year, while SoftBank recently transitioned its shareholding in Tokopedia to the Vision Fund. That latter detail is what held up this deal, which had been agreed in principle back in October, TechCrunch understands.Tokopedia didn’t comment on its valuation, but TechCrunch understands from a source that the deal values the company at $7 billion. SoftBank Ventures Korea and other investors — including Sequoia India — also took part in the deal. It has now raised $2.4 billion from investors to date, with SoftBank first joining in 2014 when it led a $100 million round.The deal comes weeks after SoftBank made a $2 billion investment in Coupang, Korea’s leading e-commerce firm, at a valuation of $9 billion. Like Tokopedia, Coupang countered SoftBank as an investor before its stake transitioned to the Vision Fund.Founded nine years ago, Tokopedia is often compared to Taobao,  Alibaba’s hugely successful e-commerce marketplace in China, and the company recently hit four million merchants. Tokopedia said it has increased its GMV four-fold, although it did not provide a figure. Logistics are a huge issue in Indonesia, which is spread across some 17,000 islands. Right now, it claims to serve an impressive 93 percent of the country, while it said that one-quarter of its customers are eligible for same-day delivery on products. That’s also notable given that it operates a marketplace, which makes coordinating logistics more challenging.The firm plans to use this new capital to develop its technology to enable more SMEs and independent retailers to come aboard its platform. On the consumer side, it is developing financial services and products that go beyond core e-commerce and increase its captive audience of consumers.Despite this new round, CEO and co-founder William Tanuwijaya told TechCrunch that there are no plans to expand beyond Indonesia, which is Southeast Asia’s largest economy and the world’s fourth most populous country with a population of more than 260 million.“We do not have plans to expand beyond Indonesia at this moment. We will double down on the Indonesia market to reach every corner of our beautiful 17,000-island archipelago,” Tanuwijaya said via an emailed response to questions. (Tokopedia declined a request for an interview over the phone.)William Tanuwijaya, co-founder and chief executive officer of PT Tokopedia, gestures as he speaks during a panel session on the closing day of the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland, on Friday, Jan. 26, 2018.

World leaders, influential executives, bankers and policy makers attend the 48th annual meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos from Jan. 23 – 26. Photographer: Jason Alden/BloombergThat Indonesia-only approach is in contrast to Go-Jek, the Indonesia-based ride-hailing firm which is rapidly expanding across Southeast Asia. Go-Jek has already moved into Vietnam, Singapore and Thailand, with doubtless more plans in 2019.But Go-Jek and Tokopedia do share similarities in that they have both expanded beyond their central business.Go-Jek has pushed into on-demand services, payments and more. In recent times, Tokopedia has moved into payments, including mobile top-up and financial services, and Tanuwijaya hinted that it will continue its strategy to become a “super app.”“We will go deeper and serve Indonesians better – from the moment they wake up in the morning until they fall asleep at night; from the moment a person is born, until she or he grows old. We will invest and build technology infrastructure-as-a-services, in logistics and fulfillment, payments and financial services, to empower businesses both online and offline,” Tanuwijaya added.But, with the Vision Fund comes controversy.A recent CIA report concluded that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The prince manages Saudi Arabia’s PIF sovereign fund, the gargantuan investment vehicle that anchored the Vision Fund through a $45 billion investment.SoftBank chairman Masayoshi Son has condemned the killing as an “act against humanity” but, in an analyst presentation, he added that SoftBank has a “responsibility” to Saudi Arabia to deploy the capital and continue the Vision Fund.“We are deeply concerned by the reported events and alongside SoftBank are monitoring the situation closely until the full facts are known,” Tanuwijaya told us via email, although it remains unclear exactly what Tokopedia could (or would) do even in the worst-case scenario.Given that the Trump administration seems focused on continuing the status quo with Saudi Arabia as a key ally, the situation remains in flux, although there’s been plenty of discussion around whether the Saudi link makes the Vision Fund tainted money for founders.Son himself said recently that he hadn’t heard of any cases of startups refusing an investment from the Vision Fund, but he did admit that there “may be some impact” in the future.Tanuwijaya didn’t directly address our question on whether he anticipates a backlash from this investment. The Vision Fund’s recent deal with Coupang doesn’t appear to have generated a negative reaction.Even the involvement of Alibaba throws up other questions, given that it owns Lazada — which is arguably Southeast Asia’s most prominent e-commerce service.Unlike Tokopedia, Lazada covers six markets in Southeast Asia, it is focused on retail brands and it maintains close links to Alibaba’s Taobao service, giving merchants a channel to reach into the region. According to sources who spoke to TechCrunch earlier this year, Tokopedia’s management was originally keen to take money from Alibaba’s rival Tencent, but an intervention from SoftBank forced it to bring Alibaba on instead.Tanuwijaya somewhat diplomatically played down the rivalry and any rift, insisting that there is no impact on its business.“Tokopedia is an independent company with a diversified cap table,” he said via email. “No single shareholder owns the majority of the company. We work closely with our shareholders’ portfolio companies and tap into available synergies.”“For example, Tokopedia works closely with both Grab — a SoftBank portfolio — and Gojek — a Sequoia portfolio. We see Lazada having a different business model than us: Lazada is a hybrid of retail and marketplace model, whereas Tokopedia is a pure marketplace. Lazada is [a] regional player, we are a national player in Indonesia,” he added.Tokopedia has many similarities to Alibaba’s hugely successful Taobao marketplace in ChinaTokopedia has many similarities to Alibaba’s hugely successful Taobao marketplace in ChinaAt nearly a decade old, Tokopedia was one of the earliest startups to emerge in Indonesia. Famously, Tanuwijaya and fellow co-founder Leontinus Alpha Edison famously saw nearly a dozen pitches for venture capital rejected by VCs before they struck out and raised money.Compared to now — and entry to the Vision Fund for “proven champions,” as Son calls it — that’s a huge transition, and that’s not even including the business itself, which has broadened into financial products and more. But that doesn’t always sit easily with every founder. Privately, many will often concede that the “best” days are early times during intense scaling and all-hands-to-the-pump moments. Indeed, Traveloka — a fellow Indonesia-based unicorn — recently lost its CTO to burnout.Is the same likely to happen to Tanuwijaya, Edison and their C-level peers in the business?Tanuwijaya compared the journey of his business to scaling a mountain.“Leon and I are very excited entering our tenth year. When we first started Tokopedia, it was like seeing the tip of a mountain that is very far from where we stand. We promised ourselves that we were going to climb to the top of the mountain one day,” he told TechCrunch.“The top of the mountain is our company mission: to democratize commerce through technology. Today, we have arrived at the base of the mountain. We can finally touch the mountain and we can start to climb it. With this additional capital, we have the tools and supplies to achieve our mission at a faster rate. Should we think whether we are burned-out and go home to rest, or should we climb our mountain? How can we be less excited about this moment?” he added.Tokopedia has certainly become a mountain in itself. The startup is the third highest-valued private tech company, behind only Grab and Go-Jek, at $11 billion and (reportedly) $9 billion, respectively, and the fairy tale story is likely to inspire future founders in Indonesia and beyond to take the startup route. What happens to the Vision Fund and its PIF connection by then is less certain.",https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/11/tokopedia-raises-1-1b/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,

A few months ago Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg faced a similar grilling, as did Facebook’s Sheryl Sandberg and Twitter’s Jack Dorsey.Also Read : Key Takeaways From Google CEO Sundar Pichai’s US Congress HearingPichai also faced a few other bizarre questions from US Senators, some of whom clearly don’t quite have a grip on how Google’s technology operates.Sample this question from Iowa congressman (Republican) Steve King. The US congressman asked Google CEO Sundar Pichai, why a notification popped up on his seven-year-old grand-daughter’s iPhone showing a picture of her grandfather (King) before an election, with inappropriate language around it.To which, Pichai had to explain that the “iPhone is made by a different company,” drawing peals of laughter from the democrat’s bench.Another googly that came Pichai’s way was about Google’s location tracking services. Republican Ted Poe wanted to know if Google to track where he was sitting through his iPhone!Poe says: “If I stand up from where I’m sitting and if I walk over to the corner, does someone in Google know that I have moved that distance?”Pichai begins to explain that’s not how location tracking works, when the senator interrupts him.For the record, that’s not how Google’s location tracking works, although at most times it is fairly accurate down to 5 metres in open spaces, depending on the satellite lock the phone gets.Pichai’s reply was a simple: “I won’t be able to answer that without looking at the iPhone.”Clearly, the US senate needs a little better grip on technology.(Hi there!

Soldiers from both the countries verified the dismantling of guard posts in the Korean Demilitarised Zone (DMZ) by each other. The soldiers also checked that all firearms, personnel and lookout posts were removed, and tunnels and other facilities destroyed, South Korea's Defence Ministry said.",India.com,"Seoul, Dec 12 (AFP) Soldiers from North and South Korea crossed into each other’s territory peacefully for the first time on Wednesday, Seoul said, as they began checking the dismantlement of guard posts in the Demilitarized Zone.The North invaded the South in 1950, triggering the Korean War, and Seoul went on to change hands four times as Pyongyang’s Chinese-backed forces and the US-led UN troops supporting the South fought their way up and down the peninsula and back again.The conflict ended in an armistice in 1953, leaving the two technically still in a state of war, but a rapid reconciliation has taken place this year.The South’s President Moon Jae-in and Kim Jong Un, leader of the nuclear-armed North, agreed to remove a limited number of guard posts along their heavily-fortified frontier at a September summit in Pyongyang, among other measures.North Korea blew up 10 of its facilities in November, while the South tore 10 down on its own side using excavators.South Korean inspectors visited each of the guard posts on the North’s side on Wednesday to make sure they had been dismantled and all firearms and troops removed, Seoul’s defence ministry said.North Korean inspectors carried out the same process at the South’s bunkers in the afternoon, it added.Video footage showed armed South Korean soldiers shaking hands with North Korean personnel at the military demarcation line in the centre of the DMZ, before crossing to the other side.Led by the North Koreans, the Southerners walked along a path where the North’s guard posts had once stood, soldiers from both sides taking photos and filming the process as they chatted.“This marks the first time since the division that the soldiers of the North and South… are peacefully crossing the military demarcation line,” the ministry said in a statement.The North is known to have more guard posts — which include both surface structures and underground elements — and according to Yonhap news agency it now has around 150 in the DMZ, with the South having about 50.Despite its name, the area around the DMZ is one of the most fortified places on earth, replete with minefields and barbed-wire fences.But under the plans to ease tensions agreed in Pyongyang, the two Koreas have demilitarised the border truce village of Panmunjom, leaving it manned by 35 unarmed personnel from each side.Officially called the Joint Security Area (JSA), the enclave is the only spot along the 250-kilometre (155-mile) frontier where soldiers from the two Koreas and the US-led UN Command stand face to face.The dovish Moon has pursued a policy of engagement with the North, in increasing contrast to Washington, which insists pressure should be maintained on Pyongyang until it denuclearises.

38489,People would revolt if I was impeached: US President Trump,"US President Donald Trump has said people would revolt if he was impeached, adding he was not concerned about it. ""It's hard to impeach somebody who hasn't done anything wrong and who's created the greatest economy in the history of our country,"" Trump said. Reports earlier claimed Trump was concerned about impeachment over finance violations during the 2016 presidential campaign.",Reuters,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said on Tuesday he was not concerned that he could be impeached and that hush payments made ahead of the 2016 election by his former personal attorney Michael Cohen to two women did not violate campaign finance laws. “It’s hard to impeach somebody who hasn’t done anything wrong and who’s created the greatest economy in the history of our country,” Trump told Reuters in an Oval Office interview. “I’m not concerned, no. I think that the people would revolt if that happened,” he said. Federal prosecutors in New York said last week that Trump directed Cohen to make six-figure payments to two women so they would not discuss their alleged affairs with the candidate ahead of the 2016 presidential election. They said the payments violated laws that stipulate that  campaign contributions, defined as things of value given to a campaign to influence an election, must be disclosed, and limited to $2,700 per person.  Democrats said such a campaign law violation would be an impeachable offense, although senior party leaders in Congress have questioned whether it is a serious enough crime to warrant politically charged impeachment proceedings. Impeachment requires a simple majority to pass the House of Representatives, where Democrats will take control in January. But removal of the president from office further requires a two-thirds majority in the Senate, where Trump’s fellow Republicans hold sway. Cohen is scheduled to be sentenced on Wednesday in New York for his role in the payments to the two women - adult film actress Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal. Trump has denied having affairs with them. Earlier this year, Trump acknowledged repaying Cohen for $130,000 paid to Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford. He  previously disputed knowing anything about the payments. Trump has slammed Cohen for cooperating with prosecutors, alleging that the lawyer is telling lies about him in a bid to get a lighter prison term. He has called for Cohen to get a long sentence and said on Tuesday his ex-lawyer should have known the campaign finance laws. “Michael Cohen is a lawyer. I assume he would know what he’s doing,” Trump said when asked if he had discussed campaign finance laws with Cohen. “Number one, it wasn’t a campaign contribution. If it were, it’s only civil, and even if it’s only civil, there was no violation based on what we did. OK?” Asked about prosecutors’ assertions that a number of people who had worked for him met or had business dealings with Russians before and during his 2016 presidential campaign, Trump said: “The stuff you’re talking about is peanut stuff.” He then sought to turn the subject to his 2016 Democratic opponent. “I haven’t heard this, but I can only tell you this: Hillary Clinton - her husband got money, she got money, she paid money, why doesn’t somebody talk about that?” Trump said. The president said he could work with Democrats in Congress, but suggested that would not happen if they issued subpoenas and pursued investigations against him. “We’re going to go down one of two tracks. We’re either going to start the campaign and they’re going to do presidential harassment. Or we’re going to get tremendous amounts of legislation passed working together. There’s not a third track,” he said. “Look, they’ve been looking for two years about collusion. There’s no collusion,” he said.  Trump has dismissed the special counsel’s probe into possible collusion between his 2016 presidential campaign and Russia as a witch hunt.

Whatever directions the Supreme Court will give, we will follow. We will have to tackle these two issues,"" he said.The bench told Dev that they have to first come out with a policy in this regard and the second major step would be its proper implementation.The counsel appearing for Delhi government said eight weeks time was needed to come out with the policy.He said all the caterers in Delhi were licensed and were registered under the Food Safety and Standards Act.""The chief secretary is saying that stale food was being used in functions. There should be a system to check the quality of food being served in such functions,"" the bench said.The bench noted in its order that the chief secretary had informed the court that they were working on a strategy so that the quality of food in marriages was maintained.Dev also said they were also looking into the aspect of mis-utilisation of water in such functions.The court told the chief secretary to come out with a policy in this regard by within six weeks.""We grant time till January 31, 2019 to enable the LG and chief secretary to formulate a policy and to ensure its strict implementation in the larger public interest, including the interest of the people of Delhi,"" the bench said.The chief secretary also said the policy would also take into consideration the aspect of management of motels and farmhouses in and around Delhi.""The earlier policy was framed in terms of the notification dated October 30, 2007 and has been working well. It has been modified to some extent from time to time. Whether those modifications are at all necessary will also be taken into consideration. The policy shall also explore the possibility of issuing a guest control order,"" he said.""In other words, a complete and comprehensive policy will be prepared by the Government of NCT of Delhi and the LG so that there is no misuse of properties, food and water, etc. and shall also be formulated in a manner to avoid congestion including traffic problems caused due to these functions being held at these motels/farmhouses,"" the bench noted.It said the LG was free to consult the court-appointed monitoring committee on sealing and the special task force, which was set up to ensure implementation of the law on unauthorised constructions and encroachments here, on these issues.The court has posted the matter for further hearing on February 5.During the hearing on Tuesday, the bench also dealt with the issue related to a motel here which was earlier slapped with a notice by the civic agency for not complying with fire safety measures.The bench was told the Delhi government's counsel that Delhi Fire Service had recently inspected the motel and have found that some fire safety norms were not complied with yet.The counsel appearing for motel said they have complied with nine out of 11 objections raised by the authority and work for the remaining two aspects was going on.""Take your time and do the rest. Wedding season or no wedding season, we cannot put the lives of people on risk,"" the bench told the counsel appearing for the motel after he urged that they be given two-three days time to complete the work.The court vacated its earlier interim order and directed for re-sealing of the motel on December 15.The top court is seized of the issue related to the validity of the Delhi Laws (Special Provisions) Act, 2006 and subsequent legislation which protect illegal construction from being sealed.",http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/delhi/2018/dec/12/food-wastage-at-weddings-contemplating-limiting-number-of-guests-delhi-government-tells-sc-1910500.html?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,

38509,Aware of atrocities: Twitter CEO Dorsey on Myanmar tweets,"Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey on Wednesday tweeted he was ""aware of the human rights atrocities and suffering in Myanmar"" in response to criticism over his tweets about a meditation retreat in the country. ""I didn't intend to diminish by not raising the issue,"" he added. Dorsey was criticised over not mentioning Rohingya Muslims' ethnic cleansing in his tweets about Myanmar.",Reuters,"(Reuters) - Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey on Wednesday said he was “aware of the human rights atrocities and suffering in Myanmar,” responding to criticism over his tweets about his meditation retreat in the country that did not mention the plight of Rohingya Muslims. More than 730,000 Rohingya fled a sweeping army crackdown in Myanmar’s Rakhine state in 2017, the United Nations and aid agencies say. The crackdown was launched in response to insurgent Rohingya attacks on security forces. U.N.-mandated investigators have accused Myanmar’s army of “genocidal intent”. Myanmar has denied the accusations, saying its forces engaged in a counter-insurgency operation against “terrorists”. On Wednesday, Dorsey said his visit was “purely personal” and he did not “intend to diminish by not raising the issue, but could have acknowledged that I don’t know enough and need to learn more”. In his initial messages on the social network, Dorsey said, “Myanmar is an absolutely beautiful country. The people are full of joy and the food is amazing.” They included pictures of the barren monastery room in which he stayed during the retreat, as well as an analysis of his heart rate while meditating. There was no reference to the Rohingya. The comments drew critical comments from human rights observers and users of Twitter.  In August, Reuters described how hate speech spread on social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook at the peak of Myanmar’s military crackdown. Dorsey said Twitter was a way for people to share news and information about events in Myanmar, as well as “bear witness to the plight of the Rohingya and other peoples and communities”. He added, “We’re actively working to address emerging issues. This includes violent extremism and hateful conduct.” Last month, Dorsey triggered a social media storm in India after a picture of him with a placard reading “Smash Brahminical patriarchy”, referring to the highest Hindu caste, went viral. Twitter later apologised for the photo.

38511,No plans to launch China search engine: Google CEO Pichai,"Google CEO Sundar Pichai on Tuesday said the technology giant has no plans to launch a search engine in China. Google has faced criticism from lawmakers and employees over a search product complying with China's censorship laws. Pichai said this at the US congressional committee's hearing on 'Transparency & Accountability: Examining Google and its Data Collection, Use, and Filtering Practices'.",Reuters,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Google has “no plans” to relaunch a search engine in China though it is continuing to study the idea, Chief Executive Sundar Pichai told a U.S. congressional panel on Tuesday amid increased scrutiny of big tech firms.  Lawmakers and Google employees have raised concerns the company would comply with China’s internet censorship and surveillance policies if it re-enters the Asian nation’s search engine market. Google’s main search platform has been blocked in China since 2010, but the Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) unit has been attempting to make new inroads into the country, which has the world’s largest number of smartphone users. “Right now, there are no plans to launch search in China,” Pichai told the U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary Committee. But he added that internally Google has “developed and looked at what search could look like. We’ve had the project underway for a while. At one point, we’ve had over 100 people working on it is my understanding.” Pichai said there are no current discussions with the Chinese government. He vowed that he would be “fully transparent” with policymakers if the company brings search products to China. In a letter in August to U.S. lawmakers, Pichai said providing such a search engine would give “broad benefits” to China but that it was unclear whether Google could launch the service there. A Chinese government official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, told Reuters last month that it was unlikely Google would get clearance to launch a search service in 2019. Pichai did not say what steps Google would take to comply with Chinese laws if it re-entered the market. Under questioning from Democratic Representative David Cicilline, Pichai said he would “happy to engage” to discuss legislation that would empower the Federal Trade Commission to address discriminatory conduct online. Cicilline told Pichai it was “hard for me to imagine that you could operate in the Chinese market under the current government framework and maintain a commitment to universal values, such as freedom of expression and personal privacy.” The company’s rivals in shopping and travel searches have long complained about being demoted in Google search results. Much of the House hearing focused on Republican concerns that Google’s search results are biased against conservatives and that the company had sought to influence the outcome of the 2016 presidential election. Democrats rejected that claim as “fantasy,” and at least one said the search results highlighted more conservative voices. Pichai said the search engine attempts to help people register to vote or find a polling place, but rejected assertions the company paid for Latino voters’ transportation to polls in some states.  “We don’t engage in partisan activities,” Pichai told the panel.

They had ensured that 190.5 overs of play were possible despite the first, third and fourth days' play being abandoned without a ball bowled.",Cricket Country,"December 12, 2000. A drab, rain-washed Test, in which less than 200 overs were possible, came to an end. Abhishek Mukherjee looks at an uneventful day that had a surprise in store after the match was over.South Africa had already clinched the series by the time the two sides met at the New Wanderers for the third Test. An emphatic 160 from Jacques Kallis and Makhaya Ntini’s 6 for 48 in the second innings had left South Africa to chase a mere 101 at Bloemfontein. Daryl Tuffey fought back, reducing the hosts to 75 for 5, but South Africa reached home.Matthew Sinclair’s 150 took New Zealand to 298 at St George’s Park, and despite Neil McKenzie’s 120, Chris Martin restricted South Africa’s lead to 63. Unfortunately, nobody other than Mark Richardson put up any fight, and chasing 86, South Africa won by 7 wickets.New Zealand dropped Craig Spearman and Kerry Walmsley at New Wanderers, recalling Tuffey and drafting in debutant Hamish Marshall. With Allan Donald injured, South Africa handed a cap to 21-year old tearaway Mfuneko Ngam.Protean seamers lead routHeavy rain and waterlogged outfield prevented any play on Day One, but the groundsmen did an excellent job. Pollock gave Ngam new ball, and he found the edge of Adam Parore (opening in place of Spearman) in his first over; Daryll Cullinan grassed the chance at slip. He did it again in Ngam’s third over.Boeta Dippenaar, meanwhile, dropped both Richardson and Parore at short-leg. They grinded along, putting up 37 before Ntini struck in the 21st over, sending Parore back.Richardson and Sinclair added 46 in an hour before they were dismissed in the space of five balls, the former being Ngam’s first Test wicket when he nicked one to Mark Boucher for 46. New Zealand were soon reduced to 117 for 6, and it took some gritty batting from Marshall (he was hit on his helmet multiple times en route to his 40) to see them reach a round 200. READ: Two or more people sharing Man of the Match award in TestsMartin had picked up his customary duck, but he struck in the evening, removing Gary Kirsten caught by Richardson at short-leg before stumps. Dippenaar and Nicky Boje batted out time, and the hosts finished on 18 for 1. On a lighter note, they still needed 133 to save the follow-on.Scott’s work, followed by Dippenaar’sAll chance of a result disappeared when it rained incessantly Days Three and Four. There was no chance of cricket on Day Five either, but Chris Scott and his team of groundsmen did a tremendous job.When play eventually got underway, Dippenaar and night-watchman Boje added 69. Pollock could probably have declared at this stage. There were over 75 overs left in the day, and with some aggressive declaration, Fleming and Pollock could have breathed life into the Test.But Pollock decided otherwise. To be fair to him, it had been a year since Hansie Cronje’s infamous declaration against England at Centurion. Anything unusual might have caused a stir.Dippenaar continued to bat on in the company of Kallis, and eventually reached his hundred off 190 balls. He was bowled by Shayne O’Connor soon afterwards. The partnership, too, had added 100 in 236 balls, killing the match and letting Scott’s work go waste.With Brooke Walker ruled out of action, New Zealand were left without a spinner. Reluctant to put strain on his fast bowlers, Stephen Fleming got Nathan Astle and Craig McMillan, brothers-in-law, to send down 17 overs between them.Kallis and Cullinan played out time, and things reached a new low when they scored 9 from 14 overs after tea. They decided to end the torture on 261 for 3, with Marshall and Sinclair providing the final touches with their bowling.A pleasant surprise awaited Chris Scott and his team after the match. They had, after all, done all the hard work over three days, while the players had slogged it out over two, one innings each. Ted Wood adjudicated the groundsmen the Men of the Match.Brief scores:New Zealand 200 (Mark Richardson 46, Hamish Marshall 40*; Makhaya Ntini 3 for 29) drew with South Africa 261 for 3 decl.

In a court hearing in Vancouver, British Columbia, Justice William Ehrcke granted C$10 million ($7.5 million) bail to Meng, who has been jailed since her arrest on Dec. 1. The courtroom erupted in applause when the decision was announced. Meng cried and hugged her lawyers. Among conditions of her bail, the 46-year-old executive must wear an ankle monitor and stay at home from 11 p.m. to 6 a.m. Five friends pledged equity in their homes and other money as a guarantee she will not flee.  If a Canadian judge rules the case against Meng is strong enough, Canada’s justice minister must next decide whether to extradite her to the United States. If so, Meng would face U.S. charges of conspiracy to defraud multiple financial institutions, with a maximum sentence of 30 years for each charge. The arrest of Meng has put a further dampener on Chinese relations with the United States and Canada at a time when tensions were already high over a trade war and U.S. accusations of Chinese spying.  U.S. President Donald Trump told Reuters on Tuesday he would intervene in the U.S. Justice Department’s case against Meng if it would serve national security interests or help close a trade deal with China. Speaking in Beijing, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang said Meng’s arrest “was a mistake from the start”.  “We have already made clear our position to the United States and Canada, who should immediately correct their mistake and release Meng Wanzhou,” he told a daily news briefing. “Any person, especially if it is a leader of the United States, or a high-level figure, who is willing to make positive efforts to push this situation toward the correct direction, then that, of course, deserves to be well received.” China had threatened severe consequences unless Canada released Meng immediately, and analysts have said retaliation from Beijing over the arrest was likely. The U.S. State Department is considering issuing a travel warning for its citizens, two sources said on Tuesday. The Canadian government was considering issuing a similar warning, Canada’s CTV network reported. Reuters was not able to confirm the report. Earlier on Tuesday, the Canadian government said that one of its citizens in China had been detained. The International Crisis Group think-tank said on Wednesday it had received no information from Chinese officials about the detention of its employee, former Canadian diplomat Michael Kovrig, and that it was seeking consular access to him. The Chinese ministry spokesman, Lu, said he had nothing he could say on the details of the case, but said the ICG was not registered in China as a non-governmental organization and Kovrig could have broken Chinese law. The Canadian government said it saw no explicit link to the Huawei case. However, Guy Saint-Jacques, Canada’s former ambassador to China, asked by the Canadian Broadcasting Corp whether the Kovrig detention was a coincidence, said: “In China there are no coincidences ... If they want to send you a message they will send you a message.”   Meng, who was arrested as she was changing planes in Vancouver, has said she is innocent and will contest the allegations in the United States if she is extradited. Tuesday was the third day of bail hearings. Meng’s defense had argued that she was not a flight risk, citing her longstanding ties to Canada, properties she owns in Vancouver and fears for her health while incarcerated. Her family assured the court she would remain in Vancouver at one of her family houses in an affluent neighborhood. Her husband said he plans to bring the couple’s daughter to Vancouver to attend school, and Meng had said she would be grateful for the chance to read a novel after years of working hard. “I am satisfied that on the particular facts of this case ... the risk of her non-attendance in court can be reduced to an acceptable level by imposing bail conditions,” said the judge, adding that he was also persuaded by the fact that Meng was a well-educated businesswoman with no criminal record.  She must remain in Canada and be accompanied by security guards when she leaves her residence. Meng will pay a cash deposit of C$7 million, with five guarantors liable for a remaining C$3 million if she absconds. Meng was ordered to reappear in court on Feb. 6 to make plans for further appearances. Huawei, which makes smartphones and network equipment, said in a statement it looked forward to a “timely resolution” of the case. “We have every confidence that the Canadian and U.S. legal systems will reach a just conclusion,” it said, adding that it complied with all laws and regulations where it operates. The case against Meng stems from a 2013 Reuters report here about Huawei's close ties to Hong Kong-based Skycom Tech Co Ltd, which attempted to sell U.S. equipment to Iran despite U.S. and European Union bans. Huawei is the world’s largest supplier of telecommunications network equipment and second-biggest maker of smartphones, with revenue of about $92 billion last year. Unlike other big Chinese technology firms, it does much of its business overseas.

Known for his fiery 'hate-speeches', Lodh was the flagbearer for the party's attempt to make inroads in India's most recently formed state. While K Chandrashekhar Rao and his Telanagana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) managed to bag a majority in the 119-member state assembly by bagging 88 seats, other parties including the Congress, the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) and the BJP failed to make their mark in the elections.For those who have not heard of Lodh, he is the man who was personally endorsed by Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath when he visited Telanagana ahead of the state elections as the party's ""star-campaigner"". It was during a rally in Lodh's home constituency of Goshamahal where the UP CM voiced his vision to rename Hyderabad to ""Bhagyanagar"", an idea which prompted sharp reactions from social media users.
In fact, reports by sections of the media have asserted that Lodh currently has more than 60 cases registered against him, mainly for his 'inflammatory comments' and 'hate speeches'.

But we don’t want to erase anyone from the face of India, said Rahul Gandhi.New Delhi: A resurgent Congress on Tuesday made significant gains in the Assembly elections, dealing a body blow to the BJP in Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan and was locked in a cliffhanger in Madhya Pradesh.The reverses for the BJP in the Hindi heartland threw wide open the 2019 Lok Sabha elections which until a few months ago appeared to be in the grip of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s party.The Assembly polls held for five states also saw the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) recording a landslide win for a second consecutive term and the Mizo National Front (MNF) scripting a spectacular victory dislodging the Congress in its last bastion in the Northeast to return to power after 10 years.Buoyed by the Congress’ good showing in the polls that was dubbed as a semi-final for the 2019 general elections, party president Rahul Gandhi said the outcome is a “clear message” to the Modi government that people are not happy with it and time has come for a change.Prime Minister Narendra Modi got a massive mandate but refused to listen to “heartbeat of the country”, Gandhi told reporters.With Congress set to form governments in Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan and locked in a close fight in Madhya Pradesh, Gandhi said the selection of chief ministers in the three states will be done “smoothly”.“We have defeated the BJP in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh… There will be no issue over (selection of) chief minister. It will be done smoothly.”Modi congratulated the Congress, the TRS and the MNF for their victories and said the BJP accepts people’s mandate with humility.“Victory and defeat are an integral part of life. Today’s results will further our resolve to serve people and work even harder for the development of India,” he said.Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said the results were certainly not as expected and asserted the poll outcome was an opportunity to pause and analyse.In a shock result, the Congress ended Chief Minister Raman Singh’s uninterrupted 15-year rule in Chhattisgarh. It won 22 and was leading in 46 in the 90-member House while the BJP was relegated to a distant second spot winning 3 and ahead in 13, according to latest trends available with the Election Commission.Raman Singh submitted his resignation to Governor Anandiben Patel and said he accepts responsibility for BJP’s poor showing.Rajasthan Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje too handed over her resignation to Governor Kalyan Singh in Jaipur.The Congress was heading towards majority in the desert state, winning 87 seats and leading in another 12 out of 199 seats.The BJP had 72 seats in its kitty and was ahead in one.As voting trends and results slowly trickled, the Congress, which had just 58 seats in the outgoing Assembly in Madhya Pradesh, was set to cross the 100 mark in a House of 230.The Congress was winning or leading in 113 seats while for the BJP this was 110.According to Election Commission data, both the BJP and the Congress had around 41.2 per cent votes each.Three-time Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, who was battling anti-incumbency, won the Budhni seat but a dozen ministers were trailing behind Congress candidates.Senior Congress leader Jyotiraditya Scindia said the trends reflected people’s desire for a change in Madhya Pradesh while state Congress chief Kamal Nath exuded confidence they will form the government in the state.“Trends show Congress marching ahead to victory in Rajasthan, MP and Chhattisgarh.

Around 14 more institutes would be participating in the development programme.Director of IIT Patna, Pushpak Bhattacharyya talking about the impact said the technology would touch everything from e-commerce firms to educational institute which uses chatbots.It has huge potential as business prospects for corporates. The project will be partly funded by the govt. It might be acquired by big corporates, Bhattacharya added without divulging any details.At present, in virtual assistance segment Amazon’s Alexa, Apple’s HomePod and Google’s Home are popular devices. All of them are globally available in English, German, French, Italian and Spanish but have very low penetration when it comes to having a reach in regional languages in India.In India, the regional language users have grown at over 40 per cent in the last seven years. They are expected to continue growing and touch over 530 million in the next three years. Whereas, English is expected to reach only 199 million, by that period.This is where NITI Aayog sees a huge opportunity for India’s own virtual assistant device available in local languages.The development was reported by ET.",https://entrackr.com/2018/12/niti-aayog-alexa-like-device/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,

38571,'Gucci priest' probed by Church over Instagram pictures,"Russia's Orthodox Church is investigating a priest named Vyacheslav Baskakov over a series of Instagram posts in which he is seen flaunting items of luxury brands, including Gucci shoes and Louis Vuitton handbags. The account belonging to Baskakov has now been deleted. Baskakov later issued an apology and said that most of the items did not belong to him.",RT,"The ‘Gucci priest’ was one of Russia’s biggest viral stories last week. An Instagram account attributed to cleric from the city of Tver sparked outrage with many images of expensive luxury items, including shoes, slippers, luggage bags and accessories. The author apparently had a soft spot for Louis Vuitton, although Gucci was a favorite too.The photos were months old, but last week the account was highlighted by a popular Russian online fun board, Pikabu, sparking a wave of outrage and puzzlement. “This is the clergy we get,” said the headline of the post, and many commenters agreed, saying the man bragging about his posh lifestyle hardly qualifies to be a spiritual guide.Others thought the account was too outrageous to be genuine. They suggested it must be some anti-clerical project meant to satirize priests that think too much about body and too little about soul.“Look at what’s written under this photo of an iPhone case from Montblanc. ‘Recommended by the Holy See’. It’s a Catholic term, while the priest is supposed to be Eastern Orthodox,” one such skeptic wrote.The viral notoriety apparently was not what the Instagram poster expected, because he soon deleted the page. But not before online sleuths credibly identified him as Vyacheslav Baskakov, an actual archpriest from Tver.On Sunday, Baskakov published an open letter, acknowledging that he was behind the inappropriate Instagram account and asking forgiveness for his sin. But he insists that the sin was vainglory, not avarice, as critics would presume.He claims most of the brand items seen in the photos did not belong to him and were shot in shops. “No priest can afford such things. And why would he? Now I consider those photos stupid, childish and even sinful,” he wrote, adding that his boasts were an attempt to be “an open person”.And those shoes he is shown wearing nowhere near a shop? Baskakov insists they are counterfeit. “I fixed buckles on almost all of them myself. Those shoes are cheap, but they look festive. I wanted some festivity in my clothes to cheer up after services,” the priest said.The cleric said a doctor told him once that changing things in his life was good for wellbeing, so that’s what he did. And now, “my fame is in my shame”.We’ll see if the church disciplinary probe into his love for posh things is convinced.Like this story?

38581,4 dead after gunman opens fire inside Brazil cathedral,"At least 4 people were killed on Tuesday after a gunman opened fire inside a cathedral in Brazil, fire department officials said. The attacker stormed into the Metropolitan Cathedral in the city of Campinas and began shooting at people as they prayed, according to reports. The gunman later killed himself at the altar.",Reuters,"SAO PAULO (Reuters) - A gunman opened fire inside the Catholic cathedral in the Brazilian city of Campinas on Tuesday and fatally shot four people praying in the pews before killing himself after police wounded him, authorities said. Police identified the shooter as Euler Fernando Gandolfo, 49, a systems analyst with no criminal record.  Gandolfo entered the cathedral and sat down among mainly elderly worshippers who remained to pray after midday mass. “I suddenly saw a man stand up, take position in front of a couple and shoot them point blank. I ran out fast and he continued firing, many shots,” said Pedro Rodrigues, a 66-year-old retiree. “It was frightful,” said another witness, Alexandre Moraes, on GloboNews channel. “He shot randomly at people. They were all praying.” Campinas police chief Jose Henrique Ventura said security cameras showed Gandolfo walk into the cathedral and sit down. A little later he started shooting at people. Police in the plaza outside rushed in when they heard the shots, Ventura told a news conference. The gunman ran to the altar while firing at police and was hit in the side. He fell to ground and shot himself in the head, Ventura said. Gandolfo had two guns with 28 rounds left when he died. Four people were shot dead and four others were wounded, but Ventura said they were out of danger in a hospital in Campinas, an industrial city 100 kilometers (62 miles) northwest of Sao Paulo.  Police have not established a motive. Brazil had nearly 64,000 murders last year - more than any other country, according to the United Nations. However, random mass shootings are relatively rare, with few American-style shootings in schools or other public areas. The rise in armed violence helped far-right politician Jair Bolsonaro win October’s presidential election, vowing to crack down on corruption, drug gangs and crime in the streets of Brazilian cities. Bolsonaro, who takes office on Jan. 1, plans to ease gun laws to allow Brazilians to arm themselves against criminals, a policy his critics say will only increase the murder rate.

In Australia's second innings, Aaron Finch was caught off off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin's bowling but he didn't use the DRS after consulting partner Marcus Harris. Replays later suggested that the ball had not touched the gloves.",India.com,"Australia Test skipper Tim Paine has questioned the DRS, saying it a frustrating and an imperfect system. Australia endured some frustrating moments during their 31-run loss to India in the first Test when a few decisions went against the hosts after reviewing the umpires calls.“Look, it’s (DRS) not a perfect system and I haven’t got the answers. It’s just frustrating, I’d imagine it’s frustrating for everyone. But it is what it is,” Pain said to the ‘Sydney Morning Herald’.Umpire Nigel Llong had given Ajinkya Rahane out caught at bat-pad for 17 early on Sunday but the decision was overturned on review when replays indicated that the ball had hit the batsman’s front pad outside the line of off stump and missed his bat and gloves.Similarly, Cheteshwar Pujara, who had scored a gritty 123 in the first innings, was adjudged out on eight and 17 to Lyon on Saturday but the dismissals were overturned. Replays found no contact with bat or gloves in his first dismissal and the second one was overruled as ball tracking suggested that the ball would have gone over the bails.The Australian skipper initially said the calls had been “interesting,” then when later asked why DRS was interesting, he said: “I think everything. I don’t want to talk about DRS. It’s just – it is what it is.“A lot of balls seem to be going over the top of the stumps, I know that that live don’t look like they are. So yeah, it is what it is.”In Australia’s second innings, Aaron Finch was caught in close to off-spinner R Ashwin but he didn’t use the DRS after consulting partner Marcus Harris. Reviews suggested that the ball had not touched the gloves and later third umpire Chris Gaffaney informed Nathan Lyon there was not enough evidence to overturn the decision.Paine said: “It’s one of those things. You can’t do much about it. We’ve been told Aaron’s, for instance, would still not have been overturned. Yeah, the DRS is interesting.“It’s a bit different when the batters are out there, it’s up to those two, isn’t it? Aaron felt something on his glove, it ended up being his pad, that can happen.“From a bowling and in-the-field perspective, we’ve got a process we go through with myself and the bowler. Nathan Lyon’s at point a lot, he gives us an indication of height. You have to take everyone’s piece of information and make good decisions. We got a couple wrong but that can happen.” Former skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni was against the usage of DRS in Tests and India avoided the technology for eight years after its introduction in Test cricket in 2008.But after Virat Kohli became the captain, India agreed to the use of DRS in 2016.Paine also backed pacer Mitchell Starc to rediscover his best in the bouncy tracks of Perth in the second Test after the opening Test where he didn’t look menacing despite taking five wickets.“When Stacy’s on song, there is no better bowler in the world, particularly with the new ball,” Paine told cricket.com.au.“In Perth, the conditions will suit him down to the ground … from what I am hearing, the wicket is going to be really fast so he’ll be a handful,” Paine admitted Starc was not at his best at Adelaide but acknowledged his role in the team.“He didn’t set the world on fire but I think, for a long time, there’s been a really big gap between Stacy’s best and his worst,” Paine said.“And from what I’m seeing, that is getting closer and closer every day. Was he at his best? Probably not. But I still thought he played his role.”(With PTI inputs)",https://www.india.com/sports/india-vs-australia-drs-is-frustrating-and-not-a-perfect-system-says-australia-skipper-tim-paine-after-the-1st-lose-at-adelaide-3473183/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,

38591,Facebook patents tech to predict users future location,Facebook has filed patents with the US Patent and Trademark Office for technology that uses location data to predict where users are going and when they will be offline. This is based on a users previously logged location data and location data of other users. It will use the locations network coverage data to pre-load News Feed for offline users.,Engadget,"Facebook might not only know where you are in the future, but also where you're going next. Buzzfeed News has discovered that the social network has filed a patent application entitled ""Offline Trajectories"" for a technology can predict where you're going ""based at least in part on previously logged location data."" Based on the application's wording, it'll be able to use your previously logged location, as well as other people's, to make predictions.Say, you typically go to a specific restaurant after spending time at the gym. The technology starts by determining your current location, and if you're at the gym, it will compute for the probability that you're going to that restaurant next. If it determines that you are indeed heading to that restaurant and that location typically has spotty coverage, it can pre-load the News Feed for you.Facebook could also rely on other users' location data to predict your movements, though, especially those with the same profile. Another patent application entitled ""Location Prediction Using Wireless Signals on Online Social Networks"" is for a technology that can use the strength of WiFi, Bluetooth, cellular and near-field communication (NFC) signals. If people of the same age as you typically visit a set of specific locations in your city in one outing, it can make a prediction based on that behavior. For example, if users with a similar profile usually go to a Starbucks next to the movie theater after seeing a movie, Facebook will anticipate that you're going to that Starbucks after watching a film, as well.These patents show that tech giants will continue to look for ways to gather more information about you.

38592,Court rejects ex-Nissan Chairman's appeal to end detention,"A Tokyo court on Tuesday rejected ousted Nissan Chairman Carlos Ghosn's appeal to end his detention. Ghosn has been held in a Tokyo jail since his arrest on November 19 for allegedly understating his pay for five years. He was re-arrested on fresh allegations of understating his income for three more years, with his detention being extended till December 20.",Reuters,"TOKYO (Reuters) - A Tokyo court on Tuesday rejected ousted Nissan Motor chairman Carlos Ghosn’s appeal to end his detention following his arrest last month on allegations of financial misconduct. Ghosn has been held in a Tokyo jail since he was arrested on Nov. 19 on suspicion of conspiring to understate his pay by about half of the actual 10 billion yen ($88 million) awarded over five years from 2010. He was officially charged on Monday. He was also re-arrested on fresh allegations of understating his income for three more years through March 2018, with the Tokyo District Court extending his detention until Dec. 20. Ghosn’s lawyers filed an appeal to overturn the detention midday Tuesday, but it was rejected by the court by evening. From indictment, cases typically take months to go to trial. In the past, suspects who have been indicted have seldom been freed on bail, but in recent years that has become more common, said Masashi Akita, a defense lawyer.  It is unclear whether Ghosn would be freed on bail as some legal experts have said he may be a flight risk. Nissan, which fired Ghosn as chairman days after his arrest, has said the misconduct was masterminded by the executive with the help of former Representative Director Greg Kelly, who was also indicted on Monday. Kelly will also remain detained until Dec. 20, the district court said. Ghosn’s lawyer in Tokyo, Motonari Otsuru, could not be reached at his office for comment. But Kelly’s lawyer, Yoichi Kitamura, said he was certain that his client’s innocence would become clear in court. “The reason I’m confident is because there was no violation of the financial instruments and exchange law,” he said. Ghosn’s arrest marks a dramatic fall for a leader once hailed for rescuing Nissan from the brink of bankruptcy. The executive has been treated like others in detention, held in a small, chilly room, with limited opportunities to shower and shave, a person familiar with the matter has said. Asked about criticism that Japanese prosecutors often try to force confessions from suspects, deputy prosecutor at the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office, Shin Kukimoto, has said no such method was being used with Ghosn and Kelly.

""It's a great result for India and the team,"" he added. India's previous Test victory against Australia at Adelaide had come in 2003, when Wright was the coach.",Cricket Country,"Former India coach John Wright went down the memory lane after India secured a 1-0 series lead against Australia with their 31-run win in the Adelaide Test on Monday.Chasing 323, Australia fought hard but were bowled out for 291 in their second innings on the fifth and final day. While India “were the better team” Wright feels that they should not get carried away with this win.“It’s a great result for India and the team,” Wright told mid-day. “I think they were the better team at this game. Take the good things, take that confidence into the next Test, start again, keep your feet on the ground but don’t get carried away.”India’s previous Test win at Adelaide Oval came under the captaincy of Sourav Ganguly with Wright as the head coach. After the first Test of that series ended in a a draw, Rahul Dravid put up an excellent batting performance to guide India to a memorable win and give them a 1-0 lead.That series though ended in a 1-1 draw as Australia came back by winning the third Test and drawing the fourth. “The 2003-04 win in Adelaide was fantastic. We all thought it would have been nice to win the series, but we couldn’t achieve that. Let’s hope we can [do it] this time,” he said.While Cheteshwar Pujara was chosen as the player of the match for his superlative century in the first innings and another vial half-century in the second dig, Jasprit Bumrah’s contribution was equally significant. He ended with match figures of 6/115 including three vital breakthrough to push Australia’s chase off the track.It was Wright who spotted Bumrah during a domestic T20 competition and then secured his services for Mumbai Indians. He’s happy how the 25-year-old’s career has progressed since then without taking any credit for his success. “I’m glad to see him come through and deliver. All credit to Jasprit.

37134,Amazon Alexa once told user 'Kill your foster parents': Report,"A Reuters report has claimed that Amazon's digital assistant Alexa told a customer, ""Kill your foster parents"" during AI experiments last year. Alexa also reportedly chatted with users about sex acts and dog defecation. Amazon said their AI research aims at making Alexa mimic human banter and users can participate in chatbot trials by saying ""let's chat"" to their devices.",Reuters,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Millions of users of Amazon’s Echo speakers have grown accustomed to the soothing strains of Alexa, the human-sounding virtual assistant that can tell them the weather, order takeout and handle other basic tasks in response to a voice command. So a customer was shocked last year when Alexa blurted out: “Kill your foster parents.” Alexa has also chatted with users about sex acts. She gave a discourse on dog defecation. And this summer, a hack Amazon traced back to China may have exposed some customers’ data, according to five people familiar with the events. Alexa is not having a breakdown. The episodes, previously unreported, arise from Amazon.com Inc’s strategy to make Alexa a better communicator. New research is helping Alexa mimic human banter and talk about almost anything she finds on the internet. However, ensuring she does not offend users has been a challenge for the world’s largest online retailer. At stake is a fast-growing market for gadgets with virtual assistants. An estimated two-thirds of U.S. smart-speaker customers, about 43 million people, use Amazon’s Echo devices, according to research firm eMarketer. It is a lead the company wants to maintain over the Google Home from Alphabet Inc and the HomePod from Apple Inc.  Over time, Amazon wants to get better at handling complex customer needs through Alexa, be they home security, shopping or companionship. “Many of our AI dreams are inspired by science fiction,” said Rohit Prasad, Amazon’s vice president and head scientist of Alexa Artificial Intelligence (AI), during a talk last month in Las Vegas. To make that happen, the company in 2016 launched the annual Alexa Prize, enlisting computer science students to improve the assistant’s conversation skills. Teams vie for the $500,000 first prize by creating talking computer systems known as chatbots that allow Alexa to attempt more sophisticated discussions with people. Amazon customers can participate by saying “let’s chat” to their devices. Alexa then tells users that one of the bots will take over, unshackling the voice aide’s normal constraints. From August to November alone, three bots that made it to this year’s finals had 1.7 million conversations, Amazon said. The project has been important to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, who signed off on using the company’s customers as guinea pigs, one of the people said. Amazon has been willing to accept the risk of public blunders to stress-test the technology in real life and move Alexa faster up the learning curve, the person said. The experiment is already bearing fruit. The university teams are helping Alexa have a wider range of conversations. Amazon customers have also given the bots better ratings this year than last, the company said. But Alexa’s gaffes are alienating others, and Bezos on occasion has ordered staff to shut down a bot, three people familiar with the matter said. The user who was told to whack his foster parents wrote a harsh review on Amazon’s website, calling the situation “a whole new level of creepy.” A probe into the incident found the bot had quoted a post without context from Reddit, the social news aggregation site, according to the people. The privacy implications may be even messier. Consumers might not realize that some of their most sensitive conversations are being recorded by Amazon’s devices, information that could be highly prized by criminals, law enforcement, marketers and others. On Thursday, Amazon said a “human error” let an Alexa customer in Germany access another user’s voice recordings accidentally. “The potential uses for the Amazon datasets are off the charts,” said Marc Groman, an expert on privacy and technology policy who teaches at Georgetown Law. “How are they going to ensure that, as they share their data, it is being used responsibly” and will not lead to a “data-driven catastrophe” like the recent woes at Facebook? In July, Amazon discovered one of the student-designed bots had been hit by a hacker in China, people familiar with the incident said. This compromised a digital key that could have unlocked transcripts of the bot’s conversations, stripped of users’ names. Amazon quickly disabled the bot and made the students rebuild it for extra security. It was unclear what entity in China was responsible, according to the people. The company acknowledged the event in a statement. “At no time were any internal Amazon systems or customer identifiable data impacted,” it said. Amazon declined to discuss specific Alexa blunders reported by Reuters, but stressed its ongoing work to protect customers from offensive content. “These instances are quite rare especially given the fact that millions of customers have interacted with the socialbots,” Amazon said. Like Google’s search engine, Alexa has the potential to become a dominant gateway to the internet, so the company is pressing ahead. “By controlling that gateway, you can build a super profitable business,” said Kartik Hosanagar, a Wharton professor studying the digital economy. Amazon’s business strategy for Alexa has meant tackling a massive research problem: How do you teach the art of conversation to a computer? Alexa relies on machine learning, the most popular form of AI, to work. These computer programs transcribe human speech and then respond to that input with an educated guess based on what they have observed before. Alexa “learns” from new interactions, gradually improving over time. In this way, Alexa can execute simple orders: “Play the Rolling Stones.” And she knows which script to use for popular questions such as: “What is the meaning of life?” Human editors at Amazon pen many of the answers. That is where Amazon is now. The Alexa Prize chatbots are forging the path to where Amazon aims to be, with an assistant capable of natural, open-ended dialogue. That requires Alexa to understand a broader set of verbal cues from customers, a task that is challenging even for humans. This year’s Alexa Prize winner, a 12-person team from the University of California, Davis, used more than 300,000 movie quotes to train computer models to recognize distinct sentences. Next, their bot determined which ones merited responses, categorizing social cues far more granularly than technology Amazon shared with contestants. For instance, the UC Davis bot recognizes the difference between a user expressing admiration (“that’s cool”) and a user expressing gratitude (“thank you”). The next challenge for social bots is figuring out how to respond appropriately to their human chat buddies. For the most part, teams programmed their bots to search the internet for material. They could retrieve news articles found in The Washington Post, the newspaper that Bezos privately owns, through a licensing deal that gave them access. They could pull facts from Wikipedia, a film database or the book recommendation site Goodreads. Or they could find a popular post on social media that seemed relevant to what a user last said. That opened a Pandora’s box for Amazon. During last year’s contest, a team from Scotland’s Heriot-Watt University found that its Alexa bot developed a nasty personality when they trained her to chat using comments from Reddit, whose members are known for their trolling and abuse. The team put guardrails in place so the bot would steer clear of risky subjects. But that did not stop Alexa from reciting the Wikipedia entry for masturbation to a customer, Heriot-Watt’s team leader said. One bot described sexual intercourse using words such as “deeper,” which on its own is not offensive, but was vulgar in this particular context. “I don’t know how you can catch that through machine-learning models. That’s almost impossible,” said a person familiar with the incident. Amazon has responded with tools the teams can use to filter profanity and sensitive topics, which can spot even subtle offenses. The company also scans transcripts of conversations and shuts down transgressive bots until they are fixed. But Amazon cannot anticipate every potential problem because sensitivities change over time, Amazon’s Prasad said in an interview. That means Alexa could find new ways to shock her human listeners. “We are mostly reacting at this stage, but it’s still progress over what it was last year,” he said.

Their skills are tough and they are not compromising on playing as hard as they can. They are giving a hundred per cent, but if something needs to be said, it is not abusive. You can be aggressive but you still need to respect your opposition and that to me is what the Australian cricket brand is.Maybe we have not always been like that and certainly deserve some criticism for having gone over the top. But in my mind, this team is playing good Australian brand of tough cricket,” he added.The third Test is scheduled to get underway on December 26, Boxing Day and both teams would be aiming to take an unassailable lead in the series.

Russia opened fire on the Ukrainian ships and then seized them and their crews near Crimea - which Russia annexed from Ukraine in March 2014. The Kerch Strait is the only outlet to the Sea of Azov and controls access to two major Ukrainian ports.

37164,What is Angel Tax controversy and why are startups opposing it?,"Introduced in 2012 to prevent money laundering, 'Angel Tax' is a 30% tax levied when unlisted companies receive funding at a valuation higher than its ""fair market value"", which Indian government counts as income and hence taxes it. Over the past few weeks, several startups have protested on receiving Income Tax notices and being fined for non-payment of the tax.",The News Minute,"Dreaded by most early-stage entrepreneurs, the issue of Angel Tax has come back to haunt them. Over the past few weeks, several startups have reportedly been receiving notices from the I-T department asking them to clear taxes on the angel funding they raised, and in some cases, levying a penalty for not paying Angel Tax.However, this is not the first time that this issue has come up. Startups have been raising the issue of Angel Tax for years, requesting the government to do away with it. Even when the union budget was announced last year, startups were hoping for the abolishment of Angel Tax.So, what is Angel Tax?Angel Tax is a 30% tax that is levied on the funding received by startups from an external investor. However, this 30% tax is levied when startups receive angel funding at a valuation higher than its ‘fair market value’. It is counted as income to the company and is taxed. Angel tax was introduced in 2012, with the purpose of keeping money laundering in check.Why is Angel tax problematic?There is no definitive or objective way to measure the ‘fair market value’ of a startup. Investors pay a premium for the idea and the business potential at the angel funding stage. However, tax officials seem to be assessing the value of the startups based on their net asset value at one point. Several startups say that they find it difficult to justify the higher valuation to tax officials.In a notification dated May 24, 2018, the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) had exempted angel investors from the Angel Tax clause subject to fulfilment of certain terms and conditions, as specified by the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP). However, despite the exemption notification, there are a host of challenges that startups are still faced with, in order to get this exemption. Income Tax noticesOne of the reasons put forward by the Income Tax Department to send such notices is to get information for distinguishing the genuine startups from the bogus ones. The notices essentially fall under two brackets: Notices under section 56(2)(viib) of the Income Tax Act, which is called income from other sources. This section states that any excess consideration received by a company will be treated as its income if it issues shares to a resident at a price which exceeds the fair market value of the shares. The section is invalid if consideration is received from venture capital companies, venture capital funds or a class of persons notified by the government.Notices under section 142(1) of the I-T Act. An assessing officer sends a notice under this section to procure additional documents needed to carry out a scrutiny assessment. The assessing officer has to complete an assessment within 21 months of the end of the assessment year or 33 months of the end of the financial year.The government’s standEarlier in the year, the Department of Revenue (DoR) had issued a notification directing assessing officers not to take coercive steps on recovery of angel tax against registered start-ups. But unregistered startups who have already raised angel investment, may still be under the scanner of the income tax authorities.On Thursday, the CBDT issued a statement that no coercive action related to tax recovery would be taken till an expert panel resolves this issue. “CBDT recognizes that startups are going to bring a lot of innovation to the country and, therefore, have to be supported in every possible manner,” the CBDT statement said.A panel of eminent experts from IITs and IIMs will be formed soon to prepare a new framework for recognition of startups.",https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/explainer-what-angel-tax-controversy-and-why-are-startups-opposed-it-93800?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

World's richest person Jeff Bezos' wealth peaked at $168 billion in September but reduced to $115 billion at year-end despite a $16 billion gain. Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg recorded biggest loss and his current wealth is $49.7 billion.",BloombergQuint,"(Bloomberg) -- The richest people on Earth lost $511 billion this year after record first-half gains were obliterated by a succession of bruising market selloffs.Global trade tensions and worries about a U.S. recession dragged markets lower at year-end, leaving the 500 people on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index with a combined net worth of $4.7 trillion as of Friday’s close. It’s only the second annual decline for the daily wealth index since its 2012 debut, and represents a sharp about-turn from the start of the year, when bullish investors helped propel the fortunes of the richest to a record $5.6 trillion.“As of late, investor anxiety has run high,” said Katie Nixon, chief investment officer at Northern Trust Wealth Management. “We do not expect a recession, but we are mindful of the downside risks to global growth.”Even Jeff Bezos, who recorded the biggest gain for 2018, wasn’t spared the volatility. His fortune peaked at $168 billion in September, a $69 billion gain. It later tumbled $53 billion -- more than the market value of Delta Air Lines Inc. or Ford Motor Co. -- to leave him with $115 billion at year-end.The Amazon.com Inc. founder had a better year than Mark Zuckerberg, who recorded the biggest loss since January, dropping $23 billion as Facebook Inc. careened from crisis to crisis. Overall, the 173 U.S. billionaires on the list -- the largest cohort -- lost 5.9 percent from their fortunes to leave them with $1.9 trillion.Even Asia’s fabled wealth-creation machine stumbled as the region’s 128 billionaires lost a combined $144 billion in 2018. The three biggest losers in Asia all hailed from China, led by Wanda Group’s Wang Jianlin, whose fortune declined $11.1 billion.Despite the turmoil, Asia continued to mint new members of the three-comma club. The Bloomberg index uncovered 39 new members from the region in 2018, although that status proved short-lived for some. About 40 percent had lost their 10-figure status as of Dec. 7.The Middle East had an even more turbulent year. While many of the billionaires ensnared in Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s corruption crackdown were released, doubt and fear about the powerful royal’s methods sent a chill through the Saudi economy.The Kingdom’s richest person, Prince Alwaleed, who was released in March after 83 days in detention, lost $3.4 billion. His net worth has fallen by 60 percent since its peak in 2014. One of the remaining Saudi captives, Mohammed Al Amoudi, managed to become richer during his year in detention, as the value of his Swedish energy and property assets rose. The Saudi government confirmed this month that he was facing charges on graft and corruption and is awaiting trial. Meanwhile, Africa’s richest saw their fortunes shrink by 14 percent as the emerging-market rout hammered assets.From Zara founder Amancio Ortega to former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, most of Europe’s billionaires saw their fortunes fall. Germany’s Schaeffler family, the majority shareholders of car-parts maker Continental AG, lost the most as extra costs and tough business conditions in Europe and Asia hampered the company’s performance.Georg Schaeffler and his mother Maria-Elisabeth Schaeffler-Thumann are $17 billion worse off than at the start of the year. That sum alone would place them among the world’s 100 richest people.Mexico’s Carlos Slim, the majority shareholder of Latin America’s largest mobile-phone operator, also suffered big losses. Once the world’s richest person, Slim now ranks sixth with a $54 billion pile. 3G Capital co-founder Jorge Paulo Lemann saw his fortune drop the most among Latin American billionaires, losing $9.8 billion. But even with that fall, he remains Brazil’s richest person.Russian fortunes on average fared better. The volatility caused by collapsing oil prices, a flare-up in tensions with Ukraine and tightening sanctions was partially offset by periodic gains. The combined net worth of the country’s 25 wealthiest people was down only slightly, ending at $255 billion, according to the ranking.Still, 16 of the 25 Russian billionaires on the Bloomberg index saw their net worth fall in 2018. Aluminum magnate Oleg Deripaska, who remains under U.S. sanctions, lost the most -- $5.7 billion -- and dropped out the Bloomberg ranking of the world’s top 500 richest people.By contrast, energy moguls Leonid Mikhelson, Gennady Timchenko and Vagit Alekperov added a total of $9 billion. Timchenko, sanctioned in 2014, added 27 percent to his net worth as shares of gas producer Novatek rose 40 percent.Those gains were the main reason why energy billionaires as a group had the best year, adding a collective $6 billion. Technology fortunes -- the best performing in 2017 after climbing $262 billion -- were down a total of $55 billion, even including Bezos’s gain. All other industries were down, including a $75 billion decline for retail tycoons and a $79 billion drop for industrialists.The number of women on the list inched up by one to 66 as Denise Coates, the British founder and chief executive officer of online bookmaker Bet365 Group Ltd., joined the ranking for the first time. She pocketed 220 million pounds ($282 million) in remuneration last year, one of the highest disclosed pay packages anywhere, after the company reported record results.©2018 Bloomberg L.P.",https://www.bloombergquint.com/global-economics/world-s-richest-lost-511-billion-in-a-year-of-market-turmoil?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

""Then, we keep on complaining that they work in similar kind of films. It's kind of hypercritic statement,"" added Zeeshan.",Pinkvilla,"Shah Rukh Khan, Katrina Kaif and Anushka Sharma's film has finally hit the screens yesterday, and some liked it, while others did not. There's a mixed sort of response that the movie has been getting from the audience and critics. The movie has SRK playing Bauua Singh who is vertically challenged but is full of life and loves to experiment. This is the first time that we have seen a Bollywood superstar play this kind of a role. It is an experimental move by SRK. We got in touch with Zeeshan Ayyub who plays the role of Bauua Singh's friend in Aanand L Rai's Zero to know his take on the mixed response by the audience. Do you agree with Zeeshan's thoughts? Let us know in the comments section below!Taking a risk and wanting the audience to cherish it is one thing, taking a risk wanting to show off/make money is another. SRK was in the first type early in his career - like in Dil Se. It didnt make money, but became a classic over the years - everything from story to screenplay to music was top notch - Jiya Jale, Satrangi and Chaiyya are unparalleled even today. But off late - Raaees, RaOne and now,Zero are all in the second category. Its like,"" Look, Im doing something different, so come pay money and watch my movie""Hello bollywood ould go bankrupt if they thought let's not think about money. It's a creative industry but it is an industry. And if itvwent just there would be no movies artsy or not.Nope, Zero was NOT a risk-taking movie, it was just cleverly disguised as one. You have SRK and Anushkha playing characters with disabilities, Katrina doing a Cocktail Veronica like role and throw in some VFX so you can claim you are doing something ""different"" and hoping that is what critics will latch onto. But people are smarter. There is no getting around the fact that you still had SRK play a 30 something bachelor, Anushka is in full makeup / styling in a very inaccurate portrayal of Cerebral Palsy (they've cherry picked the parts of the illness so that she can claim disabled but still glamorous, all the while ignoring the real life problems these patients face) and on top of everything - for all the reviews about her finally ""acting"" you still had to rely on Katrina's item songs. And the space stuff was downright stupid. After all their claims of risk taking- at heart, it is still the stupid Bollywood masala formula everyone is sick ofActually, Zero is not SRK taking a risk as an actor, but as a producer, working with VFX and a quirky script with things not typically seen in Indian cinema, giving a voice to people with various disabilities and taking the setting to Bollywood all the way to space. But as an ACTOR, he is still afraid to ever have his characters be aged his real age or fray from two models, the immature rascal (Raj, Rahul, Arjun, Ajay, Bauaa...) or the mature protector (Harry, Kabir, Mohan, Veer...). Someone should dare all 3 Khans to pick scripts for each other and do each other's roles for a while. Shahrukh Khan should do a full-out action movie like Tiger, Aamir should do a love story, he hasn't in forever, and Salman should do a movie with REAL stars like Anushka and Katrina instead of D-list Race stars.Risks were taken teams of films like- Gangs Of Waseypur, Dum Laga Ke Haisha, Badhaai Ho, Queen, Fukrey, Karwaan. Maybe some didn't become huge hits, but whoever went into the theatre to watch them came out feeling entertained.the comment above explains my thoughts exactly. So thank you for writing.The problem is when Shahrukh decides he will experiment but does not get out Shahrukh Khan out of the character.Experiement with looks,experiment with style just because u r short(ZERO) or look young(FAN) does not make that an experiment. Still waving arms out as that is your style making the same facial expressions etc.what are you experimenting? How you will look shorter,in underwear in Times Square is that really an experiment.Loved Anoushka,Katrina, Zeeshan and all supporting actors.Take risks with a good script and a good direction and watch the wonders at the boxoffice. Trying different things doesn't mean success. Doing good movies brings you success.zeeshan these films may involve risk but they are BAD. no-one pays to go watch risks in the cinema...we pay to watch good cinema. aamir has managed to take successful risks so far in the industry quite consistently.. TOH was his least risky outing if anything, but it was plain bad.",https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-zeeshan-ayyub-zero-if-srk-or-salman-take-risks-people-still-want-see-them-same-pattern-435124?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

""Not just the farmers of Punjab but those of the entire nation had appreciated his government's initiative, which had been replicated now by the newly installed Congress regime in three other states,"" he added.The Chief Minister pointed out that his government had so far disbursed Rs. 3595.04 crore to 428246 farmers against their debts, with the process for loan waiver to 159632 small farmers also initiated.

Security forces also recovered arms and ammunition from the site.",The New Indian Express,"SRINAGAR: Al Qaeda’s Kashmir cell Ansar Ghazwatul Hind (AGH) was dealt a severe blow on Saturday, with security forces killing six militants of the Zakir Musa-led outfit, including its deputy chief, in Pulwama district of south Kashmir.Based on intelligence inputs about the presence of militants in Awantipora area of the district, the police, CRPF and army launched a cordon and search operation early on Saturday, a police official said. During the operation, the personnel came under heavy firing from militants hiding in the region.“The troops returned the fire, and in the ensuing gunfight, which went on for nearly three hours, six militants of the AGH were killed,” the official added. Arms and ammunition, including rifles, were recovered from the site of encounter.The deceased were identified as Soliha Mohammad Akhoon, Faisal, Nadeem Ahmad Sofi, Rasiq Mir, Rouf, and Umar, all residents of Tral in Pulwama district.Soliha was the deputy chief of the AGH and an active militant since 2015.“He was involved in many attacks on security forces,” said a police official, adding that the other slain militants were also part of several incidents of violence in south Kashmir.The bodies were handed over to their legal heirs after the completion of medico-legal formalities, and later in the day, thousands of people attended funeral prayers for the slain militants at their respective hometowns and chanted pro-freedom, pro-Zakir Musa and anti-India slogans.Speaking about the encounter, Inspector General of Police (IGP) Kashmir S P Pani told this newspaper that the six militants killed were key operatives of the AGH.“It is a severe jolt to the Zakir Musa-led faction,” he added, highlighting that no collateral damage was sustained in the encounter. Zakir Musa, a close aide of former Hizb commander Burhan Wani, had rebelled against the Hizbul Mujahideen, and now heads the AGH.

37185,Allow Assange to leave Ecuador embassy freely: UN tells UK,"The UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention has asked the UK to allow WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange to leave Ecuador's embassy in London without fear of arrest or extradition. ""The only ground remaining for Assange's continued deprivation of liberty is a bail violation in the UK that cannot justify over six years' confinement he's been subjected to,"" UN experts said.",Reuters,"GENEVA (Reuters) - U.N. rights experts called on British authorities on Friday to allow WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange to leave the Ecuador embassy in London without fear of arrest or extradition. The U.N. Working Group on Arbitrary Detention reiterated its finding published in February 2016 that Assange had been de facto unlawfully held without charge in the embassy, where he has now been holed up for more than six years. He initially took asylum to avoid being extradited to Sweden, where authorities wanted to question him as part of a sexual assault investigation. That investigation was dropped.  Assange, whose website published thousands of classified U.S. government documents, denied the Sweden allegations, saying the charge was a ploy that would eventually take him to the United States where prosecutors are preparing to pursue a criminal case against him. Britain says Assange will be arrested for skipping bail if he leaves the embassy, but that any sentence would not exceed six months, if convicted. It had no immediate comment on the experts’ call, but in June, foreign office minister Alan Duncan said Assange would be treated humanely and properly. “The only ground remaining for Mr Assange’s continued deprivation of liberty is a bail violation in the UK, which is, objectively, a minor offense that cannot post facto justify the more than six years confinement that he has been subjected to since he sought asylum in the Embassy of Ecuador,” the U.N. experts said in a statement. “It is time that Mr Assange, who has already paid a high price for peacefully exercising his rights to freedom of opinion, expression and information, and to promote the right to truth in the public interest, recovers his freedom,” they said. Lawyers for Assange and others have said his work with WikiLeaks was critical to a free press and was protected speech.    The experts voiced concern that his “deprivation of liberty” was undermining his health and could “endanger his life” given the disproportionate amount of anxiety that has entailed. Ecuador in October imposed new rules requiring him to receive routine medical exams, following concern he was not getting the medical attention he needed. The rules also ordered him to pay medical and phone bills and clean up after his cat. Assange has sued Ecuador, arguing the rules violate his rights. An Ecuadorean court on Friday upheld a prior ruling dismissing Assange’s suit. “We have lost again,” said Carlos Povedo, Assange’s attorney in Ecuador, adding that the legal team would consider bringing a case to the Inter-American Court of Human Rights.

37187,"I don't have a degree, should've started career later: Kareena","Actress Kareena Kapoor Khan, while speaking about her regrets on her radio show 'What Women Want', said, ""I don't have a degree...I always feel that I should have started my career a little later."" ""I took a very quick decision and started shooting at the age of 17. I feel that I should have studied a lot more,"" she added.",Pinkvilla,"It is always said that education is important! Several actors in Bollywood have often said that they regret not completing their education so as to start working at a very young age. Recently, Kareena Kapoor Khan on her radio show opened up about her regrets of not completing her education and starting her acting career early. She stated, ""I always feel that I should have started my career a little later. I took a very quick decision and started shooting at the age of 17. I feel that I should have studied a lot more.""She also said, ""In today's times, education is very important and I should have actually got my degree. I could have started doing what I wanted to do which is acting and that I could have done a bit late. Today, that's what I feel, of course, I couldn't study a lot and I don't have a degree, I will always probably push Taimur to finish his education and then do what he wants to do. That's his choice of what he wants to become in his life. I think that I would push him to finish his education because this is one thing that I would have wished, I should have made that decision a little later.""Do you agree with Kareena? Let us know in the comments below.Meanwhile, on the work front, Kareena will soon start shooting for Raj Mehta's Good News alongside Akshay Kumar, Diljit Dosanjh and Kiara Advani. The film is co-produced by Karan Johar under his home banner Dharma Productions and it will release next year.Finally Kareena has learnt a thing or 2 seeing Sara. Kareena mostly spoke nonsense and Sara speaks only sense that’s education. Glad for TaimurA college degree is important as with higher education you get perspective, gain understanding and maturity. Even if the kid ends up in the entertainment industry he will have an option of another career, if he wants. It is a great security blanket and it’s important to not rely on fickle entertainment business of short marketability spans depending on youth alone.Education is something that makes you wise and it shows in all of Sharmila’s children and grand children. Soha ended up in the film industry but she judges a quiz show and writes books - she’s no bimbo. There are alternate professions but only for people who are educated.. actresses have an expiration date, unfortunately. Sara also sounds very classy and humble, which is why she’s so likeable. This is all coming from good upbringing and a solid education.What's the point in spending on an expensive degree if you are planning to join Bollywood? Soha Ali Khan has pricey Oxford degree but she has the same Instagram career that Kareena does which is sad because both Soha and Kareena deserve good roles. Bollywood heroine careers are short-lived if they ever get to win the rat race that is. Degrees from foreign countries cost a few $100000. It's probably no big deal for rich families like those of Sara, Soha, Aryan, Navya etc but it's stupid to throw a fortune at something for ""fun"" or ""personal experience"".why not? Personality development is key - Look at the way sara speaks and other speak - there is a marked dfiference.who needs education to make money. High school drop outs and some forgot to go to school, making tons of money just doing item numbers.One of the best things u can do for your child is give him/her an education which brings knowledge and opens up the mind. Nobody can take it away from you .Well done Kareena.I wish Kareena would stop belittling herself like this always. She talks as if she never stepped foot in a school but she's more educated than most in Bwood with two years of college, then some law studies then a summer course at Harvard. Others don't reveal their lack of education and some pretend that they were higher educated in America when in fact they never stepped foot in a college. The only females with degrees are Sara, Soha and Parineeti. Same goes for Saif too. He studied at good schools and even at Winchester.Lol, can't believe people are making comments that degrees are useless. Saif is clearly so much smarter than Kareena and his been around the block and back with two kids already, he knows what to do with them. Everything Saif and Amrita did with their kids clearly worked out, people adore Sara. Kapoors sprout nonsense, be it Kareena, Rishi, Ranbir, and so on.I wish Kareen would stop belittling herself. The only people with degrees are Sara, Soha and Parineeti. She actually went to college for 2 years and is more educated than most. She even studied a bit of law and a summer course at Harvard. Others keep quiet about not even accomplishing this and others pretend they are highly educated in America but never stepped foot in a college. Same goes for Saif, not everybody can say the studied at WinchesterWisest thing she's said in a while.Degree is overrated, esp. since degree and job skills are not related. Basic but quality education till 10/12th is good enough if one is going into entertainment, business, sports, etc. with millions of returns.Its only the job market that requires a degree that too has no value in real work. And returns are very less, barely touching lakh.Kareena, stop using your child for publicity and then you can get him educatedThere are so many people in Bollywood wotourt degrees... PC does not have a college degree , nor does her husband Nick Jonas,, nor does kat, nor does dp nor does ........ and ... and list goes on and onKareena does not need Saif to influence her, in this day and age any person would like there kids to be educated specially after Kareena having so much exposure inth eoutside worldThis is saifs good influence on her. Saif is very clear that his kids hv to get a degree before entering Bollywood. So I think he’s made this clear to Kareena as well",https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/photos/kareena-kapoor-khan-i-dont-have-degree-i-will-always-push-taimur-ali-khan-finish-his-education-434958?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
37188,Tharoor says Ashwin should open with Mayank in 3rd Australia Test,"Congress MP Shashi Tharoor has suggested that off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin should open with Mayank Agarwal for India in the third Test against Australia, which will commence on December 26. ""He has an organised defence and a calm head on his shoulders. And that would free up a slot for a middle-order bat or all-rounder,"" Tharoor tweeted.",Times Now,"Ahead of the third Test slated to kick off in Melbourne on the Boxing Day, the only concern over India's playing XI for the match is the opener's slot. Mayank Agarwal has already been backed by many to make his debut at the MCG, but concern seems to hover around his partner for the game. While few have kept the experienced Murali Vijay beside the debutant, few other options that have popped up include the name of Rohit Sharma and Hanuma Vihari. However, politician Shashi Tharoor has a unique option for the debatable opener's slot for the third Test. Prithvi Shaw seemed to be an ideal option for India ahead of the series kick off, but an unfortunate ankle injury during the practice game put him to the sidelines in the first two Test and later was ruled out of the series.  In the absence of the youngster, Vijay and Rahul compiled 49 runs and 48 runs respectively in the first Two Tests against Australia, while also recording a duck in the Perth Test. The poor performance of the openers urged the management to recall Mayank for the last two Tests. While the 27-year-old was devoid of a chance to make his debut on home turf against West Indies despite making it to the squad, it seems most certainly that Mayank will make his debut next week when the third Test between India and Australia kick off at the MCG. However, there seems to be a bit of doubt over his partner for the match - should it be Vihari or Rohit? And Tharoor opines Ravichandran Ashwin as an option.""The departure of @PrithviShaw is a bigger setback than the Test loss to Australia. Perhaps we should ask @ashwinravi99 to open with Mayank Aggarwal now? He has an organised defence & a calm head on his shoulders. And that wld free up a slot for a middle-order bat or all-rounder,"" tweeted Tharoor.   Well, Ashwin does have the experience to play as an opener. He had in fact started out his career in domestic cricket as an opener. Meanwhile, former cricketer Sanjay Manjrekar opined Mayank to open with Murali in Melbourne. ""I will personally still go (open) with Mayank Agarwal and Murali Vijay,"" Manjrekar told IndiaTV.

Given the success of Baaghi and Baaghi 2, the expectations from Baaghi 3 are at an all-time high and while Tiger Shroff will return in the role of Ronnie, however, the lead actress is yet to be finalized. While Baaghi was directed by Sabbir Khan, Baaghi 2 was helmed by Ahmed Khan.In an interview to DNA, director of the film, Ahmed Khan, spoke about the buzz around the film and said, “I know there are huge expectations from Baaghi 3. I had designed the action for Baaghi 2. It was the first time a choreographer won an award in this department. Now, I want to amp it up.” While Tiger Shroff will begin shooting for the film after he wraps up Punit Malhotra’s Student of the Year 2 and the untitled film opposite Hrithik Roshan and Vaani Kapoor, the director has already zeroed in on the location and given that Baaghi series is high on action sequences, Ahmed Khan wants to shoot the film in Syria. “Along with the big action pieces, Baaghi series also has an emotional story at its centre.

37198,Naseeruddin Shah's Ajmer event cancelled after protests,"The organisers of Ajmer Literature Festival have cancelled an event in which Naseeruddin Shah was to deliver a speech, after protests by right-wing groups over his remarks on 'mob-violence'. Several right-wing activists gathered outside the venue, shouting slogans and hurling black ink at posters of the actor, as per reports. ""We cancelled the session after vandalism,"" an event organizer said.",The New Indian Express,"AJMER: Members of several right-wing groups including the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha launched an agitation outside the Ajmer Literature Festival on Friday over the participation of veteran actor Naseeruddin Shah in the event.The actor sparked controversy with his comments in a recent video interview conducted by Karwaan-e-Mohabbat India. In the interview, Shah had expressed concern over the security of his children and commented on lynchings and vigilantism.It had sparked fury across right-wing groups and was sensationalised with debates over a news channel.BJYM workers reached the platform of the festival built in an indoor stadium and proclaimed on the microphone that Shah would not be allowed to enter.They then exited the hall waving black flags.Predictably, activists said Shah’s statements had hurt the sentiments of Indians and that he has “disrespected the motherland”. Policemen present on the spot did not try to stop the protesters even as they started damaging the event’s properties on the site.  While shouting slogans against the actor, they then burnt the posters of the festival. Learning of the ruckus, Shah refrained from attending the event and instead, visited his Alma Mater, where, while speaking to reporters, he said that his statements were being misinterpreted and that he had a right to put forth his views as a concerned citizen. “I have expressed concerns about the sudden death of the policeman and cow slaughter in the Bulandshahar incident. I have not said anything untoward or opposed anyone. Being an Indian, I have expressed my thoughts. If the alleged critic can misinterpret anything said by me, then I too have a constitutional right to put forth an idea. India is my home, and I love it,” he said.",http://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2018/dec/21/naseeruddin-shahs-ajmer-event-cancelled-after-protests-by-right-wing-groups-1914749.html?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

But Swarm launched them anyway in January and once the FCC got wind, it initiated an investigation. The settlement requires Swarm to pay a $900,000 penalty and submit to extended FCC oversight over the next few years.""We will aggressively enforce the FCC's requirements that companies seek FCC authorization prior to deploying and operating communications satellites and earth stations,"" FCC Enforcement Bureau Chief Rosemary Harold said in a statement. ""These important obligations protect other operators against radio interference and collisions, making space a safer place to operate.""The FCC said it would continue to consider any new applications from Swarm on a case-by-case basis, and it issued Swarm a temporary license to launch additional satellites back in October.

Uber had failed to report the data breach on time, which had affected around 57 million users, including 1.4 million users in France. Moreover, it had also tried to pay $100,000 to the hackers before eventually reporting the breach.",TechCrunch,"One by one, European countries are slapping Uber  with a penalty for the way it handled its 2016 data breach. Today, France’s data protection watchdog, the CNIL, announced it was fining Uber $460,000 (€400,000).This event was a combination of bad security with bad reaction and good timing. Back in 2016, Uber faced a data breach that affected 57 million users, including 1.4 million users in France.According to the CNIL’s  report, hackers managed to connect to Uber’s GitHub repositories using some employee’s login and password. They then managed to connect to Uber’s Amazon Web Services account and download user data.How? Very simple. AWS login information was stored in plain text on GitHub.Two hackers behind 2016 Uber data breach have been indicted for another hackThe CNIL said that it could have been avoided if:Uber first tried to cover up the breach by paying hackers $100,000 to make them delete the data set. It eventually disclosed the breach last year.The only good news for Uber is that the breach happened slightly too early for European Union’s GDPR. Right now, if a company doesn’t report a breach to relevant authorities within 72 hours, they can end up paying a fine of up to 4 percent of the company’s global annual turnover.British and Dutch authorities previously fined Uber $490,000 and $690,000 respectively (£385,000 and €600,000).

37234,SoftBank Vision Fund to invest over $1 bn in Grab: Reports,"Masayoshi Son-led Japanese conglomerate SoftBank's $100-billion Vision Fund is planning to invest over $1 billion in Southeast Asian ride-hailing startup Grab, which may even rise up to $1.5 billion, as per reports. SoftBank had first bought a stake worth $250 million in Grab in 2014. Founded in 2012, the Singapore-based startup has raised over $6.5 billion till date.",TechCrunch,"SoftBank’s  Vision Fund is set to continue its recent spree of investments in Asian tech unicorns. The mega fund — which is targeted at $100 billion — is planning to invest upwards of $1 billion into Southeast Asia’s ride-hailing leader Grab, two sources with knowledge of the plan told TechCrunch. The investment could reach as much as $1.5 billion, one source added.A SoftBank representative did not respond to a request for comment. Grab  declined to comment.The Vision Fund has made significant investments in three billion-dollar Asian companies in recent months. That includes backing India’s OYO as part of a $1 billion round (which included money from Grab) in September, writing a $2 billion check for Korea’s Coupang in November and co-leading a $1.2 billion round for Tokopedia in Indonesia alongside Alibaba earlier this month.There is a pattern that SoftBank appears to be following here.In all three cases, the Japanese company was an existing investor and, having transferred its stakes to the Vision Fund, it then doubled down and invested again via the Vision Fund itself. That’s also the plan for this Grab deal, TechCrunch understands.SoftBank’s most recent financial report, filed in November, explains that it plans to move its stakes in ride-hailing firms Uber, China’s Didi, India’s Ola and Grab over to the Vision Fund. But that hasn’t happened yet and it isn’t clear when it will.“The Company expects that the necessary procedures will be made in the future to obtain applicable consent from limited partners of the Fund and regulatory approvals for the transfer,” it explained in the report, which doesn’t include a projected time frame.One source told TechCrunch that the investment in Grab is contingent on that equity transfer being made, as was the case with Tokopedia and Coupang, which saw SoftBank-owned stakes transferred to the fund in Q3 of this year.Grab CEO and co-founder Anthony Tan [Photographer: Ore Huiying/Bloomberg/Getty Images]While we don’t know how long that wait will be, Grab is hardly short on cash. The Singapore-based company is putting the final touches to its Series H fund which is focused on raising a total of $3 billion. It has already received significant contributions from Toyota, Microsoft, Yamaha Motors, Booking Holdings and a range of institutional investors.Grab CEO and co-founder Anthony Tan [Photographer: Ore Huiying/Bloomberg/Getty Images]Grab operates across eight markets in Southeast Asia, where it claims over 130 million downloads and more than 2.5 billion completed rides to date. The company acquired Uber’s business earlier this year in a deal that saw the U.S. company pick up a 27.5 percent stake in Grab and turn their rivalry into a partnership. The merger deal, however, was criticized by regulators and, in Singapore, the pair were fined a total of $9.5 million for violating anti-competition laws.Grab is Southeast Asia’s highest-valued tech startup, having commanded an $11 billion valuation through this Series H round. It isn’t clear how much that figure will increase if/when this Vision Fund investment closes. The company has raised around $6.8 billion to date from investors, according to data from Crunchbase.",https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/20/softbank-vision-fund-grab-1-billion/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

37245,Ousted Nissan Chairman re-arrested in Japan while still in jail,Ousted Nissan Chairman Carlos Ghosn was re-arrested by Japanese authorities on Friday on suspicion that he shifted over $16 million in personal losses to Nissan. Ghosn has been held in jail for over a month for allegedly understating his income by $80 million in 2011-2018. The re-arrest gives prosecutors the right to detain him for at least another 10 days.,Reuters,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese prosecutors arrested Nissan Motor Co Ltd’s (7201.T) ousted chairman Carlos Ghosn again on Friday on new allegations of making Nissan shoulder $16.6 million in personal investment losses, dashing chances he would be released on bail before Christmas. Prosecutors also raided Ghosn’s residence in Tokyo on Friday in search of evidence, broadcaster TV Asahi reported. The latest twist in a saga that has jolted the global auto industry and Nissan’s alliance with France’s Renault SA (RENA.PA) came a day after a Tokyo court unexpectedly rejected prosecutors’ request to extend Ghosn’s detention. That rejection had raised the possibility that the prominent businessman could go free on bail as early as Friday. The re-arrest, however, means he could be detained for at least another 10 days in a Tokyo jail, where he has been confined since he was arrested last month on initial allegations of financial misconduct.  The Tokyo prosecutor said the fresh arrest was based on suspicions that around October 2008, Ghosn shifted personal trades to the automaker to make it responsible for 1.85 billion yen ($16.6 million) in appraisal losses, and inflicted damage on Nissan by having it deposit a total of $14.7 million on four occasions between June 2009 and March 2012 into a related bank account.  His lawyer, Motonari Otsuru, was not available for comment. Otsuru has previously declined to return calls about the Ghosn case. Kyodo news agency said that when the allegation that Ghosn had shifted the paper losses first surfaced in media reports late last month, Otsuru said his client had denied it. Ghosn had considered the move but did not do so after being told by financial authorities that it would be illegal, Kyodo quoted Otsuru as saying then. Also on Friday, the Tokyo court said in a statement that the lawyer for Ghosn’s former deputy Greg Kelly, who was arrested along with Ghosn, has requested his client’s release. Kelly’s detention extension was rejected along with Ghosn’s. The lawyer, Yoichi Kitamura, later told Reuters that Kelly was unlikely to be released before Tuesday because there was not enough time to complete procedures, including the payment of any bail that might be set. The dramatic turn of events came hours after Ghosn, through his lawyer and quoted by Japanese public broadcaster NHK, vowed to restore his good name in court and to hold a news conference after his release. “Things as they stand are absolutely unacceptable,” he was quoted as saying. “I want to have my position heard and restore my honor in court.” Television camera crews had gathered outside the Tokyo jail on Friday morning in hopes of catching sight of Ghosn being released. Ghosn was initially arrested on Nov. 19 for allegedly understating his income by about half over a five-year period from 2010. He was later re-arrested for a similar alleged crime covering the past three years. The maximum penalty for both understating compensation and the latest accusation - aggravated breach of trust - is up to 10 years in prison and/or a fine of 10 million yen. Nissan said after his initial arrest that it unearthed multiple instances of possible wrongdoing in an internal investigation triggered by a whistleblower.  The internal probe is ongoing, and has included allegations of diverting company funds to pay for personal expenses. Sources have told Reuters that investigators have been looking into the use of an internal “CEO Reserve” fund and the role of overseas subsidiaries in alleged financial misconduct. The Ghosn case has put Japan’s criminal justice system under international scrutiny and sparked criticism for some of its practices, including keeping suspects in detention for long periods and prohibiting defense lawyers from being present during interrogations, which can last eight hours a day. The case also marked a dramatic fall for the leader of the Nissan-Renault-Mitsubishi Motors Corp (7211.T) alliance who was once hailed for rescuing Nissan from the brink of bankruptcy. Nissan Chief Executive Hiroto Saikawa has since called for changes to weaken the clout of controlling shareholder Renault. Documents seen by Reuters showed that some discussions about compensating Ghosn out of the public eye were not confined to Nissan, but also included Renault executives. While Nissan ousted Ghosn from his role as chairman shortly after the initial arrest, Renault has so far not replaced him. A Nissan spokesman declined to comment on the re-arrest, saying only that the internal investigation was ongoing and expanding into new areas. Renault declined to comment.

The then Pakistani dictator General Zia-ul-Haq and Chinese Vice Premier Deng Xiaoping convinced the US over aid to Pakistan, claiming India would be pro-Soviet. The US also ignored Pakistan's nuclear programme to gain its support against Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.",The New Indian Express,"WASHINGTON: The US acceded to Pakistan's demand, supported by China, to ""set aside"" its concerns over Islamabad's secretive nuclear weapons programme in the immediate aftermath of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, according to the latest documents declassified from the era.The documents, which were released by the State Department, reveal that then Pakistani dictator General Zia-ul Haq and Chinese Vice Premier Deng Xiaoping were successful in extracting this price from the US in lieu of Islamabad's support to America against the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.In addition to the US turning a blind eye to Pakistan's nuclear weapons programme, Deng also convinced the US to start giving more military and financial aid to Pakistan, according to the US Foreign Relations 1977-1980 volume on Afghanistan.The voluminous document indicates that both Zia and Deng successfully convinced the then Carter administration that India under former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi would be pro-Soviet.""There are limits on our ability to aid Pakistan because of their nuclear explosive programme.Although we still object to their doing so, we will now set that aside for the time being, to facilitate strengthening Pakistan against potential Soviet action,"" the then US Defense Secretary Harold Brown said in a January 8, 1980 meeting with Deng.Deng applauded the US decision as he was successfully able to convince the Carter administration on this issue.""That is a very good approach. Pakistan has its own reasons for developing a nuclear programme. We ourselves oppose the Pakistan effort on nuclear weapons because we believe it meaningless to spend money on such a programme,"" he said.""Pakistan has its own arguments, ie, India has exploded a nuclear device but the world has not seemed to complain about this.So now you have decided to put this aside and solve the question of military and economic aid to Pakistan. We applaud this decision,"" Deng said.He also convinced the US to not equate India and Pakistan when it comes to giving aid.""You may recall that I raised the question of aid to Pakistan with President Carter. He said the US will give aid in proportion to the population of the two countries. I said this was not feasible,"" Deng told Brown referring to his conversation with Carter.""The Pakistanis and Indians are afraid of each other. If the population ratio formula should be used, Pakistan will be in an increasingly inferior position.We hope that since the United States decided to give aid to Pakistan, it will really satisfy Pakistan's requirements.We hope your aid to Pakistan will not be affected too much by India's reaction,"" Deng said.""With regard to question of South Asia, there is no other way except giving aid to Pakistan.It has always been our view that the US policy giving more attention to India than Pakistan is not an appropriate policy.""Regarding India, we have always felt that the United States should try to cultivate good relations, and this has had a good effect.But India is not a stabilising factor. Perhaps you already know the general election results,"" Deng said.He was referring to the then just-concluded parliamentary elections in which Indira Gandhi came back to power with a majority.Observing that Gandhi had got 70 per cent of the vote, Deng said it was very difficult to judge that time how India will go.""Even if Indira Gandhi should follow India's previous policy;

37249,"Lakshmi Mittal, Shanghvi lost $10 bn in 2018, Ambani added $4 bn","The 23 richest Indians in the 500-member Bloomberg Billionaires Index saw a wealth erosion of $21 billion this year. Lakshmi Mittal, who controls the world's largest steelmaker ArcelorMittal, lost $5.6 billion, or 29% of his net worth, followed by Sun Pharma Founder Dilip Shanghvi, whose wealth declined $4.6 billion. Asia's richest person Mukesh Ambani added $4 billion to his fortune.",Bloomberg Quint,"(Bloomberg) -- The world’s fastest growing source of mega-wealth hit a speed bump this year.The 128 people in Asia with enough money to crack the 500-member Bloomberg Billionaires Index lost a combined $137 billion in 2018, the first time wealth in the region has dropped since the ranking started in 2012.Global trade tensions and concerns that stock valuations are too frothy hammered some of the area’s biggest fortunes. China’s tech sector was hit particularly hard, while India and South Korea weren’t spared. The declines occurred even as banks and money managers aggressively stepped up efforts to cater to Asia’s richest. Asian equities retreated again on Friday, with benchmarks slipping in Japan, China and Australia.“Difficult stock market conditions this year and the uncertainty of the trade tensions likely have been a challenge to many businesses,” said Philip Wyatt, a Hong Kong-based economist for UBS Group AG, who doesn’t see the downdraft continuing through 2019 or significantly reducing the ranks of billionaires. Conditions are actually ripe for the region to create more of the mega rich as new technologies attract private capital and government support, he said.For now, though, fear in the market is trampling fortunes. More than two-thirds of the 40 Chinese on the Bloomberg ranking saw their wealth dwindle. Wanda Group’s Wang Jianlin, whose property conglomerate is selling assets to cut debt, lost $10.8 billion, the most of anyone in Asia. JD.com founder Richard Liu, who was arrested in the U.S. in August for less than 24 hours on suspicion of rape before being released, took the heaviest losses in percentage terms, with his wealth cut almost in half to $4.8 billion. Liu won’t be charged, authorities in Minneapolis said Friday.India’s 23 richest people, meanwhile, saw $21 billion vanish. Lakshmi Mittal, who controls the world’s largest steelmaker, led the way, losing $5.6 billion, or 29 percent of his net worth, followed by Dilip Shanghvi, the founder of Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, the world’s fourth-largest generic drugmaker, whose wealth declined $4.6 billion.South Korea’s tycoons didn’t escape the carnage either. The market rout lopped $17.2 billion from the fortunes of the country’s seven richest people. The father and son who control Samsung Electronics, Lee Kun-Hee and son Jay Y Lee, account for more than a third of that decline.In Hong Kong, titans of real estate took a big hit. Li Ka-shing, who retired as chairman of CK Hutchison and CK Asset in March, lost $6 billion in 2018, while Lee Shau Kee, the city’s second-richest person, ends the year about $3.3 billion poorer.There were still plenty of winners to emerge from the wreckage of 2018.Lei Jun, the chairman of Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi Corp., added $8.7 billion, with a July initial public offering catapulting him into the Top 100 of the Bloomberg index after he started the year outside the ranking. The IPO also turned three of his co-founders into billionaires.Japan’s richest person, Tadashi Yanai, added $6.3 billion to his fortune as shares of Fast Retailing Co., the world’s largest apparel retailer, surged 30 percent. India’s Mukesh Ambani added $4 billion to his fortune and eclipsed Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.’s Jack Ma as Asia’s richest person, thanks in part to the performance of Reliance Industries Ltd.Among the winners, the Bloomberg Billionaires Index added new members in technology, consumer, biotech and pharmaceuticals.At least six Asian billionaires died, leaving behind a total of $29 billion.©2018 Bloomberg L.P.",https://www.bloombergquint.com/markets/asia-s-mega-rich-take-a-hit-with-137-billion-in-losses-in-2018?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

The financial institution had revealed people sent $69 billion home to India in 2017.",BGR,"Facebook and its privacy problems do not seem to have an end, just not yet. But that does not mean the company is stopping from developing new features for its services. According to Bloomberg, the social media giant is working on making a cryptocurrency that will allow its users to transfer money on its WhatsApp messaging application.The company has been working on a form of cryptocurrency for sometime now and has even escalated David Marcus to the role of exploring blockchain. Now, Bloomberg reports that Facebook is developing a stablecoin that will minimize volatility seen with other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. The social media company is far from releasing the coin and is said to be still working on the strategy. It is is planning for custody assets or regular currencies that would be held to protect the value of its stablecoin, sources familiar with Facebook’s plan told the publication.These efforts are being led by Marcus himself, who was elevated from his lead role running Messenger app to head of company’s blockchain initiatives. The report says Facebook has been on a hiring spree and now counts about 40 people in the blockchain group.“Like many other companies, Facebook is exploring ways to leverage the power of blockchain technology. This new small team is exploring many different applications. We don’t have anything further to share,” a company spokesman told Bloomberg in a statement.Facebook wants to use its stablecoin as a means of exchanging money on WhatsApp, the social messaging app used by over 1.5 billion people around the world. The service is popular in India, where it is estimated to have over 250 million users and working on launching UPI-based payment solutions for all of its users. Facebook is also encouraged by the fact that India leads the world in remittances, where people sent $69 billion home to India in 2017, according to data from the World Bank.In the past year, the number of projects surrounding stablecoins have gone up significantly. The concept is meant to create a digital coin that would be easier to use on a daily basis that something like a bitcoin. However, the idea has proven tough to replicate in real life and existing stablecoins such as Basis and Tether have been surrounded by controversies.Facebook has been experimenting with a lot of ideas as its user growth has reached a point of saturation. The company has acquired platforms like Instagram and WhatsApp to expand its reach and is now looking for new ways to make money from these services. However, with new move it takes, there will be increased skepticism and scrutiny, since the company has letdown its users multiple times in the past year alone.",https://www.bgr.in/news/facebook-developing-a-stablecoin-to-enable-transactions-on-whatsapp-report/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

""I had the opportunity to stop it and I didn't do it and that was my leadership failure,"" Smith added.",Cricket Australia,"Suspended Australia batsman Steve Smith has opened up about the ""dark days"" since the Cape Town ball-tampering scandal and praised the leadership of his successor and Test skipper Tim Paine.On Friday, Smith spoke to the media for the first time on Australian soil since his tearful press conference immediately after he returned home from South Africa, revealing there have been days where he hasn't wanted to get out of bed.But nine months on, the 29-year-old said he's in good spirits due to the strong support of close friends and family.""I’m going OK,"" Smith said at the SCG.""I’ve had tough days, I’ve had my ups and downs. But I’ve been really fortunate to have a close group of people around me to help me through those difficult times.""There have been some dark days where I haven’t wanted to get out of bed and things like that.""But I’ve had a close group of people around me to help me know that it’s OK.""I’ve made a mistake and it was a big mistake and I’m trying to move on from that and improve as a person.""Smith's 12-month ban, for his involvement in the plan to deliberately use a foreign object – sandpaper – to artificially alter the condition of the ball in the third Test against South Africa in Cape Town this year, concludes at the end of next March.While serving his ban, the right-hander has played in T20 competitions in Canada and the Caribbean, featured for Sutherland in NSW Premier (club) Cricket and has batted in the nets against Australia's Test pace trio Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood and Pat Cummins.While he has been on the sidelines, Australia have endured mixed results on the field.The ODI team was whitewashed in England and lost to the Proteas on home soil, the T20 side lost in the final of the tri-series in Zimbabwe and later drew with India at home, while the Test outfit played valiantly in a losing cause in the UAE and only this week levelled the series against Virat Kohli's India. Smith said it's been tough watching his former teammates struggle knowing he cannot help them with a match-winning performance like has done so often in the past.But Smith praised Australia for their 146-run win at Perth Stadium and the captaincy of Paine, who was made interim captain in the wakes of the Newlands episode before being handed the top job on a full-time basis.""It’s been tough (watching) at times, particularly when the boys haven’t played their best in a couple of games,"" he said.""It’s been hard watching and knowing that I can’t go out and help them.""But I was really proud of the way the boys played last week in Perth.""I thought they were magnificent and I think Tim Paine’s leadership has been exceptional since taking over as captain.""He’s obviously been faced with difficult circumstances to begin with but he’s done a terrific job.""Australia's first assignment after his ban lifts will be the 2019 Cricket World Cup and the Ashes in the UK.Smith outlined his playing schedule between now and the start of the World Cup but is not expecting to walk back into the national side as soon as he becomes eligible.Should he be picked in Australia's World Cup or Ashes squads, or both, Smith is ready for a frosty reception from the English crowds.""Hopefully (I will) get another opportunity to play for Australia,"" he said. ""And if that’s in a World Cup and Ashes, so be it.""No doubt the English crowd will be incredibly hostile and I’m ready for that if that was to happen.

37293,Several killed in Sudan in protests over rising bread prices,At least eight demonstrators were killed in Sudan on Thursday during protests against the rising prices of bread. A government decision to raise the price of bread from one Sudanese pound to three has triggered protests across the country. The cost of some commodities has more than doubled in Sudan in the past year.,The New Indian Express,"KHARTOUM (SUDAN): Eight demonstrators were killed in eastern Sudan on Thursday, officials said, during clashes with riot police on the second day of protests over the rising price of bread. A government decision to raise the price of bread this week from one Sudanese pound to three (from about two to six US cents) sparked protests across the country on Wednesday.The protests spread on Thursday to the Sudanese capital Khartoum, where riot police fired tear gas to disperse demonstrators near the presidential palace, witnesses said. ""Six were killed and a number of people were wounded"" in the eastern city of Al-Qadarif, Al-Tayeb al-Amine Tah told local broadcaster Sudania 24, without providing further details.The toll included a university student whose death during demonstrations in Al-Qadarif had been reported earlier in the day. ""The situation in Al-Qadarif is out of control and the student Moayed Ahmad Mahmoud was killed,"" said Mubarak al-Nur, a lawmaker in the city 550 kilometres (340 miles) from Khartoum. Nur called on authorities ""not to use force against demonstrators, who are asked to peacefully exercise their right"" to protest.Two other protesters were killed in the city of Atbara, around 400 kilometres east of Khartoum, governorate spokesman Ibrahim Mukhtar said.Police in Atbara fired tear gas to disperse protesters just hours after authorities imposed a curfew on the city because demonstrators had torched the headquarters of President Omar al-Bashir's National Congress Party (NCP).

He added he'd ""do everything possible"" to help those cheated by the company.",Times Now,"Former Indian cricketer Gautam Gambhir has issued a clarification after a Delhi court on Wednesday issued a bailable BW warrant against him in a case relating to real estate fraud. Gambhir was the brand ambassador of Rudra Buildwell Reality Pvt. Ltd, a real estate firm which has been accused of accused of cheating, misappropriation and conspiracy of a huge sum of money. The case pertains to a project in the NCR area which was not delivered in time to the investors. Gambhir thus had to face legal troubles as reportedly crores were collected from the investors projecting the former cricketer's name. The 37-year-old had earlier filed a revision plea in the case which was dismissed by the Saket Court. On Wednesday, Saket court CMM, Sh. Manish Khurana issued a warrant (BW - Bailable) against Gambhir for not appearing in the case repeatedly even after rejection of his revision plea.Gambhir on Thursday took to Twitter to explain his side of the story and mentioned how the dates of the hearing coincided either with his 'playing commitments for Delhi Ranji Team and/or other professional reasons.' He also mentioned that he was merely a brand ambassador of the accused company and served as an Additional Director for a short while but never had a role over the actions or in the lack of it in providing customers with the flats. ""Since last evening there’ve been media reports about bailable warrants issued against me for not appearing before the Court.I’d like to clarify that dates for appearance in Court coincided either with my playing commitments for Delhi Ranji Team and/or other professional reasons,"" Gambhir wrote in a tweet. ""I was always represented by my advocates in the Court, as I am more than willing to abide by the law of the land and honor the directions issued by the Hon’ble Court. On another note, I would like to clarify that I was merely a Brand Ambassador,"" he added. ""And an Additional Director (for a short while), of the said real estate company named M/s Rudra Buildwell Realty Pvt. Ltd. Maybe this is the price I’ve had to pay and it seems that some vested interests and publicity mongers joined in to publicize the news,"" he further wrote. 
Gambhir also clarified that the allegations of wrong-doings are against Mukesh Khurana and Babita Khurana who are the beneficiaries of the money received from the home buyers. The cricketer further asserted that he sympathised with the customers who have invested in the flats and as a responsible citizen will do everything possible to help them. ""Also, even as per the complaint, the allegations of wrong-doings are against the company and its promoters namely Mr. Mukesh Khurana and his wife Mrs.Babita Khurana who are the beneficiaries to the money received from the home buyers,"" Gambhir explained.""I never had any control over their actions or lack of it in providing the customers with their flats. My sympathies were and will always be with d customers who had invested their money to buy these flats. As a responsible citizen, I will do everything possible to help them,"" he added. Gambhir announced his retirement on December 4 from all forms of cricket after playing 58 Test matches and 147 ODIs for India scoring 4154 runs and 5238 runs respectively in the two formats. He also played 37 T20Is for the Men in Blue and scored 932 runs. Gambhir is fondly remembered for his two heroic knocks on two big finals - 2011 World Cup and 2007 World T20 respectively.

The lawmakers argued the gesture, criticised for discriminating against Muslims, represents a mark of respect for the government. The law would come into effect on January 1, however, some mayors said they will ignore the new guidelines.",RT,"The new citizenship bill has been the subject of a heated debate since last summer. It requires those applying for Danish citizenship to commit to the country’s values and to show respect for its government by shaking hands with its representative.Critics of the bill argue that it’s aimed at discouraging Muslims from seeking Danish citizenship, calling the proposal discriminatory and describing it as an unnecessary formality.The proposal was backed by Denmark’s three-party minority government, with the driving force behind the legislation being the Conservative Party and anti-immigrant Danish People’s Party.The changes to the naturalization ceremony, which come into effect on January 1, have been met with strong opposition from the local officials who conduct such proceedings. Some mayors have already said they will ignore the new guidelines. The mayor of the town of Kerteminde in central Denmark has gone so far as to imply that he would rather not show up at work than coerce an applicant to shake his hand.“Shaking hands does not show if you are integrated or not. I think I will probably find an excuse and the deputy mayor will come to work that day,” Kasper Ejsing Olesen told the Guardian earlier.READ MORE: Cheat, lie and abuse – Danish immigration minister hits out at migrantsThe red tape associated with the festive ceremony will cost taxpayers an additional 2,400 kroner ($370) – double the current fee of 1,200 kroner ($183).

I think it is a tremendously large and valuable gift,” People’s Party spokesman Christian Langball told a local broadcaster in September, as cited by the Local.Denmark’s Integration Minister Inger Stojberg, a member of the center-right Venstre party, brushed off the criticism, insisting that a handshake is “a completely natural part of the ceremony.”Stojberg said that a spokesman for Hizb ut-Tahrir, an Islamic group that openly supports the establishment of a caliphate, told her that he would not have become a Danish citizen if the rules applied retroactively.“I asked him if he would advise his followers in Hizb ut-Tahrir to pass on it, and he said he would. And that’s exactly what we want with the naturalization ceremony,” the minister said, as cited by TV2.The latest measure is another step in the Danish government’s wide-ranging crackdown on migration. Earlier this month, Stojberg proposed sending rejected asylum seekers to a remote island, about two miles from the mainland. Some 100 failed asylum seekers and criminal migrants are going to be brought to the islet in the Baltic Sea on a ferry under the plan. In August, hundreds hit the streets to protest against a “burqa ban” – another “discriminatory” measure that came into effect that month.Denmark has also been enforcing a controversial law allowing authorities to confiscate cash and valuables from refugees to fund their stay in Denmark since 2016. ",https://www.rt.com/news/447104-denmark-handshake-law-citizenship/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
37305,"US to withdraw over 5,000 troops from Afghanistan: Report","US President Donald Trump is planning to withdraw over 5,000 of the 14,000 American troops in Afghanistan, according to a US official. The reports come a day after Trump announced the withdrawal of American troops from Syria. The American troops in Afghanistan are involved in the fight against the Taliban and other militant groups, as well as training Afghan forces.",Reuters,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump is planning to withdraw more than 5,000 of the 14,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan, a U.S. official said on Thursday, in the latest sign Trump’s patience is thinning with America’s longest war and overseas military interventions. On Wednesday, Trump rebuffed top advisers and decided to pull all U.S. troops out of Syria, a decision that contributed  to U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis abruptly quitting on Thursday over significant policy differences with the president. One official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said a decision had been made and verbal orders had been given to start planning for the drawdown. The official said timelines were being discussed but it could happen in weeks or months. It is unclear how the United States with less than 9,000 forces in Afghanistan will be able to fulfill the full set of missions now underway, including training Afghan forces, advising them in the field, and waging an air campaign against the Taliban and other militant groups.  Instead, the United States almost certainly would have to curtail its missions, something that could provide an opportunity for a resurgent Taliban to expand their offensives across Afghanistan. Mattis had argued for maintaining a strong U.S. military presence in Afghanistan to bolster diplomatic peace efforts. He resigned shortly after U.S. officials raised the possibility that Trump would order the drawdown.  The decision on Syria has bewildered U.S. allies and triggered harsh reaction from Trump’s fellow Republicans in Congress.  The Pentagon declined to comment on Afghanistan. Garrett Marquis, a spokesman for the National Security Council, said the White House would not comment “on future strategic developments.” The United States went to war in Afghanistan in 2001 in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, seeking to oust the Taliban militants harboring Saudi-raised militant Osama bin Laden, who led plans to carry out the attacks. U.S. officials are currently engaged in talks with the Taliban, who now control a significant amount of territory. The Taliban insurgency has strengthened its grip over the past three years, with the government in Kabul controlling just 56 percent of Afghanistan, down from 72 percent in 2015, a U.S. government report showed. Trump privately has been grousing about U.S. military involvement in Afghanistan, telling an ally as recently as Wednesday words to the effect of, “What are we doing there? We’ve been there all these years.” The source, who asked to remain unidentified, said it appeared the president “has lost all patience” with the U.S. military presence in Afghanistan. More than 2,400 U.S. forces have died in the 17-year-old war in Afghanistan, and Pentagon officials have repeatedly warned that a precipitous exit would allow militants to develop new plots on America. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, often a vocal Trump ally, warned of possible danger to the United States if the drawdown goes through. “The conditions in Afghanistan - at the present moment - make American troop withdrawals a high risk strategy. If we continue on our present course we are setting in motion the loss of all our gains and paving the way toward a second 9/11,” Graham said in a statement. Trump last year approved an increase in U.S. troops but acknowledged that he did so reluctantly.  Late last month, at least 22 Afghan police were killed in a Taliban ambush in Afghanistan’s western province of Farah, adding to the growing casualty toll on Afghan security forces. Earlier this week, U.S. special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad and Taliban representatives held talks in Abu Dhabi on a deal that would end the war. Officials from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates also took part.  The Saudi ambassador to Washington, Khalid bin Salman, tweeted on Thursday that the discussions had been productive and would bring “very positive results by the beginning of next year.” But a former senior State Department official familiar with the issue said that the Taliban representatives rejected a proposal by Khalilzad for a ceasefire and demanded that the talks focus on a U.S. withdrawal.

The strike was called by the All India Bank Officers' Confederation, which has over 20 lakh members. The United Forum of Bank Unions also called a strike on December 26.",Reuters,"MUMBAI (Reuters) - Workers at India’s state-owned banks called a nationwide strike on Friday in protest at proposed mergers that could cause job losses and demanded immediate wage rises. The strike, by the All India Bank Officers’ Confederation (AIBOC), impacted trading volumes in foreign exchange and debt markets, said traders. Private sector banks were not affected by the strike. AIBOC has a membership of over two million officers and affiliates in all major state-run banks and 10 private banks. The striking officers are responsible for daily operations, causing a complete shutdown of services to customers. The 21 state lenders hold two-thirds of India’s banking assets and account for the bulk of the record $150 billion of soured loans in the banking sector last year. The United Forum of Bank Unions (UFBU), an umbrella body of the top nine bank unions in the country, also decided to hold a strike on December 26 against the proposed merger of Bank of Baroda, Dena Bank and Vijaya Bank. India earlier this year announced plans to merge the three state-run banks to create India’s third-largest bank as part of efforts to clean up the banking system, which has been overburdened by bad debts. The bank unions say they fear the mergers will lead to job cuts and allow private sector banks to dominate the industry. AIBOC Joint General Secretary Ravinder Gupta said the unions are demanding wage revisions based on minimum mandated wages by the government and not asking for it to be linked to profitability of the banks or their paying capacity, which could be higher.

At Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas' third wedding reception last night, the who's who of Bollywood was present. Salman Khan, Shabana Azmi, Anushka Sharma, Yami Gautam, Sameera Reddy, Kajol, Tanishaa Mukerji, Shahid Kapoor, Mira Rajput, Raveena Tandon and Pooja Hegde among others graced the occasions and blessed the newlyweds. But while the entire Bollywood brigade was present at the bash last night, newlywed Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh were the show-stealers. From sporting the finest of couture to striking just the right poses to burning the dance floor with their groovy moves – the newlywed did it all. Adding to their excitement was the fact that Bollywood actor Govinda, too, was present at the bash. The actor, who celebrates his birthday today, had the most fun time with Ranveer Singh and the latter couldn't help but post a happy photo with Govinda! He took to social media and posted a photo with Govinda wherein the two stars were sporting wide-eyed smiles. And well, there couldn't have been a better birthday wish!

The Sena also demanded the withdrawal of cases against those who demolished Babri Masjid.",Times Now,"Mumbai: The Shiv Sena on Thursday attacked senior ally BJP over the Ayodhya issue, saying the construction of Ram temple at the disputed site has become another 'jumla' (rhetoric) for the party and it would lead to their ouster from power. The party said the BJP has not woken up despite its recent electoral defeats in three states and is not ready to learn from what RSS Sarsanghchalak Mohan Bhagwat has to say in the context of teachings of the Bhagavad Gita (the Hindu scripture).There is pressure within the BJP to construct the Ram temple in Ayodhya, but when will ""achhe din"" (good days) come for Lord Ram, the Sena asked.""Shree (Mohan) Bhagwat, while citing the Bhagavad Gita says what is the use of the arrogance (by saying) what 'I' do is the best. 'I' did this. He has given a guiding principle for the BJP,"" the Uddhav Thackeray-led party said.""But what is the use? This government, like Kumbhakarna (the demon king Ravana's brother known for sleeping for months at a stretch), is not ready to wake up even after humiliating defeats in three states,"" the Sena said in an editorial in party mouthpiece 'Saamana'.The BJP recently lost power to the Congress in the three electorally important states of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. The Sena said the whole country wanted the temple to be built and that was the reason it voted for the BJP in 2014.""However, as the issue too became another 'jumla' for the party, its journey for 'wapsi' (ouster from power) has begun,"" the party said.""When will achhe din come for Lord Ram, who is living in an open tent for the last 25 years while those in power are warming their seats,"" it said in sarcastic remarks.However, on Wednesday, speaking at an event organised by the Republic TV, BJP Chief Amit Shah said: ""If the Supreme Court conducts daily hearings of the Babri demolition case, it will not take more than 10 days to get a verdict."" ""Ayodhya is a title issue. The BJP clearly states that we want to build a temple on the same site. The case was pending before the SC much before 2014.

37320,Army deployed as drones shut down UK's second-biggest airport,"The Army was deployed at the UK's second-biggest airport, the Gatwick Airport in London, after drones caused the airport to shut down for more than a day. Thousands of passengers remain stranded as several flights were diverted or cancelled. Gatwick's runway reopened on Friday, with a limited number of aircraft scheduled for departure and arrival.",Reuters,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain sent troops to its second-biggest airport after an unprecedented attempt to cripple Christmas travel with large drones forced all flights to be canceled on Thursday. As thousands of passengers waited at Gatwick Airport, south of London, police hunted unsuccessfully for the operators of the large drones which reappeared near the airfield every time the airport tried to reopen the runway. Police said there was no indication of a terrorism motive behind the devices, which first appeared on Wednesday night.  “The assessment earlier on today was that we wouldn’t be using firearms,” Detective Chief Superintendent Jason Tingley said late on Thursday. “This is continually reviewed so you will know and have seen that we have firearm officers deployed.” Europe’s air traffic control agency Eurocontrol said the airport would remain closed until 0600 GMT on Friday. The armed forces were also deployed to help resolve the situation.  “We are there to assist and do everything we can,” Defence Minister Gavin Williamson told reporters.  Drones were seen as recently as the last hour, a Gatwick spokesman said at about 2200 GMT on Thursday, more than 24 hours after their first sighting. The airport said flights would remain shut down for the rest of the evening on a day when 115,000 people were scheduled to pass through, many en route to seasonal breaks. Prime Minister Theresa May’s spokesman condemned the standoff as “irresponsible and completely unacceptable”.  Passenger Ani Kochiashvili had been bound for Georgia but spent six hours overnight sitting on a plane with her children. “I’m very annoyed because I’m with two kids, a three-month-old and three-year-old,” she told Reuters by phone among thousands camped in the terminal.  “They require a lot of space and food and changing and all that, and the airport is crazy busy so it’s challenging.”  Flights were halted at 2103 GMT on Wednesday after two drones were spotted near the airfield, triggering the biggest disruption at Gatwick since a volcanic ash cloud in 2010. Police said more than 20 units were hunting the operators near Gatwick airport, 50 km (30 miles) south of London. Transport minister Chris Grayling said it was clearly a deliberate act. “This is a commercial-sized drone,” he said. “Every time Gatwick tries to re-open the runway, the drones reappear.” Grayling temporarily lifted night-flying restrictions at other airports to ease congestion caused by diverted aircraft, Sky News reported. With a surge in public enthusiasm for drones, there has been an increase in near-collisions by unmanned aircraft and commercial jets in recent years.  The number of near misses between private drones and aircraft in Britain more than tripled between 2015 and 2017, with 92 incidents recorded last year, according to the UK Airprox Board regulator.  Richard Parker, head of air traffic management technology firm Altitude Angel, said this was the first time a major airport had been hit by such a sustained and deliberate incursion into its airspace. “It’s sophisticated, not from a technology side, but it’s organized. People have charged lots of batteries, and are deliberately trying to avoid being caught, probably by driving around to different locations,” he told Reuters.  “It really is unprecedented.” Gatwick’s Chief Operating Officer Chris Woodroofe described one of the drones as a heavy industrial model. “The police advice is that it would be dangerous to seek to shoot the drone down because of what may happen to the stray bullets,” he told BBC radio. Drone expert Peter Lee of Portsmouth University said he and others had been anticipating disruption.  “One of my concerns about today is that it may well encourage copy-cat incidents because you can achieve a high amount of disruption for a very, very low cost,” he said. It is illegal to fly drones within 1 km (0.6 mile) of a British airport boundary, punishable by five years in prison. Even after Gatwick re-opens, the backlog and disruption are expected to last for days. Gatwick said it was working with its airlines, the biggest of which also include British Airways (ICAG.L) and Norwegian (NWC.OL), on recovery plans once the runway re-opens.  Safety was its “foremost priority”, it said.  Gatwick, which competes with Europe’s busiest airport Heathrow, west of London, had previously said Sunday would be its busiest day of the festive period. Passengers took to Twitter to share their stories.  One waiting at the airport said: “At Gatwick Airport, drone chaos, surprisingly good natured, but complete mayhem.” Reporting by Sarah Young in London and Ismail Shakil in Bengaluru; Additional reporting by Alistair Smout and Andrew MacAskill; Editing by Andrew Cawthorne, Alison Williams and James Dalgleish",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-drones-gatwick/drones-paralyze-british-airport-grounding-christmas-travelers-idUSKCN1OI2TN?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
37323,US defence chief quits a day after Trump's Syria withdrawal order,"US Defence Secretary James Mattis on Thursday resigned, a day after President Donald Trump decided to pull all US troops out of Syria saying ISIS has been defeated there. You have a right to a Secretary of Defense whose views are better aligned with yours on these and other subjects, Mattis said in a letter to Trump.",Reuters,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis abruptly said he was quitting on Thursday after falling out with President Donald Trump over his foreign policies, including surprise decisions to yank troops from Syria and start planning a drawdown in Afghanistan.  Mattis announced plans to depart in a candid resignation letter to Trump that laid bare the growing divide between them, and implicitly criticized Trump for failing to value America’s closest allies, who fought alongside the United States in both conflicts. He released the letter after a face-to-face meeting with Trump in which the two men also aired their differences, a senior White House official said.  “Because you have a right to a Secretary of Defense whose views are better aligned with yours on these and other subjects, I believe it is right for me to step down from my position,” Mattis said in the letter. U.S. officials said the resignation had not been forced by Trump. Trump announced on Wednesday that U.S. troops in Syria would be withdrawn, a decision that upended American policy in the region. On Thursday, an official said the president was planning to withdraw at least 5,000 of the 14,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan - another blow to Mattis, who advocated for a strong U.S. military presence to bolster diplomatic peace efforts. Mattis, a retired Marine general whose embrace of NATO and America’s traditional alliances often put him at odds with Trump had advised against the Syria withdrawal. One official said it was a contributing factor to his resignation. The news is certain to shock U.S. military allies, already bewildered by what they see as Trump’s unpredictable, go-it-alone approach to global security, and raises questions about whether Mattis’ successor will be as steadfast about traditional treaty commitments, including to NATO. When Mattis interviewed with Trump for the job in 2016, he split with the president-elect on a host of issues, including on NATO and the use of torture. Trump ultimately deferred to Mattis, who opposed the latter, signaling that he could be persuaded by his advisers.  But as time grew, Trump increasingly acted on his own instincts on a host of national security issues, choosing an “America First” agenda that contradicted Mattis’ core beliefs. Mattis’ letter indicated that he disagreed with Trump’s isolationist policies, writing that it was his belief the United States needed to maintain strong alliances and show allies respect.  Trump has withdrawn the United States from several international agreements since taking office in January 2017. The Mattis resignation letter also said that he believed the United States “must be resolute and unambiguous in our approach to those countries whose strategic interests are increasingly in tension with ours.” He identified Russia and China as countries that “want to shape a world consistent with their authoritarian model.”  Mattis’ resignation was greeted with regret on Capitol Hill, by both Republicans and Democrats. U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell indicated he was in agreement with Mattis on America’s alliances and on Russia, whom he described as a foe. “But I am particularly distressed that he is resigning due to sharp differences with the president on these and other key aspects of America’s global leadership,” McConnell said in a statement. Senator Bob Menendez, the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, called it “a significant loss and a real indication that President Trump’s foreign policy agenda has failed and continues to spiral into chaos.”     The shifts in significant aspects of U.S. foreign policy  and Mattis’ addition to the long list of senior Trump administration figures who have quit or been removed added to the sense of an increasingly unpredictable White House as Trump approaches the halfway point of his four-year term.  And if defense policy disagreements were not enough distraction for a president who is under investigation by a special counsel over Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election, financial markets took a beating this week and a U.S. government shutdown loomed because of funding disputes over Trump’s desire to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. This year has been the worst for world stock markets since the 2008 global financial crisis, with MSCI’s 47-country world stocks index down 10 percent.     Trump, announcing Mattis’ departure on Twitter, said he would nominate a successor soon.  “General Jim Mattis will be retiring, with distinction, at the end of February, after having served my Administration as Secretary of Defense for the past two years,” he said. One possible candidate to replace Mattis as defense chief could be Republican Senator Tom Cotton, long considered a front-runner to eventually take the role.  Trump’s White House has had the highest turnover of senior-level staff of the past five presidents, according to the Brookings Institution think tank. Some departed unceremoniously, such as Trump’s first Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, whom Trump fired via Twitter in March. Speculation that Mattis might not last long in his post grew in October when Republican Trump said in a CBS interview that the general was “sort of a Democrat” and might be leaving. Mattis responded at the time by telling reporters that he had Trump’s full support. Stephen Miller, a senior White House adviser, said Trump was entitled to a Pentagon chief with whom he could agree. “This is an opportunity for the whole country to get a new secretary of defense who will be aligned with the president on these critical issues, whether you’re talking about in Syria, whether you’re talking about across the Middle East in general,” Miller told CNN.

""People outside can say what they want,"" the pacer further said.",CricTracker,"Australian pace spearhead Mitchell Starc is one of the best left-arm bowlers in the world.

Despite playing 140 international matches and creating substantial impact Stac in his 8-year career hasn’t achieved what he had set out to.After having played a lot of cricket, his inconsistent performance has kept him in news for the last couple of years. Former Australia spinner Shane Warne first shared his opinion on Starc in the year 2015 when he talked about Starc’s ‘soft’ body language. But the pacer said that he has nothing to prove to anybody on that.AdvertisementStarc has again been criticised by Warne who is commentating during the Test series between India and Australia. The hosts lost the first Test to India and Starc had scalped 5 wickets there by giving 103 runs in the two innings. Warne was not satisfied with his performance and even wrote about it in the Daily Telegraph.He mentioned that Starc had lost his rhythm and questioned his decision to not feature more domestic cricket as it would’ve helped him get back in form.Australia levelled the series 1-1 at Perth and prior to the match, Warne had stated that Starc might lose his place in the playing XI. That was not to be and Starc, in fact, gave them a really good start in both the innings to finish the game with another five wickets. In the process, he also became only the second left-hander, and 17th player, to take 200 Test wickets for Australia.While talking about the criticism he has faced, the 28-year old shared that he is not at all bothered about that as the team, coach, as well as the captain all, are happy with his performance. He further said that people have been criticizing him right after his debut and these all will not ‘hurt’ him anymore.“He’s been on my back since I made my debut, so I don’t really care what Shane says,” Starc was quoted as saying by Sportsar.“I’m not going to pay attention to him. As long as the coach, the captain, the team and the staff are happy with the role I’m playing and I’m doing that job for the team, that’s what matters to me,” he further added. “People outside can say what they want.

But I’ve been really fortunate to have a close group of people around me to help me through those difficult times.""There have been some dark days where I haven’t wanted to get out of bed and things like that.""But I’ve had a close group of people around me to help me know that it’s OK.""I’ve made a mistake and it was a big mistake and I’m trying to move on from that and improve as a person.""Smith's 12-month ban, for his involvement in the plan to deliberately use a foreign object – sandpaper – to artificially alter the condition of the ball in the third Test against South Africa in Cape Town this year, concludes at the end of next March.While serving his ban, the right-hander has played in T20 competitions in Canada and the Caribbean, featured for Sutherland in NSW Premier (club) Cricket and has batted in the nets against Australia's Test pace trio Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood and Pat Cummins.While he has been on the sidelines, Australia have endured mixed results on the field.The ODI team was whitewashed in England and lost to the Proteas on home soil, the T20 side lost in the final of the tri-series in Zimbabwe and later drew with India at home, while the Test outfit played valiantly in a losing cause in the UAE and only this week levelled the series against Virat Kohli's India. Smith said it's been tough watching his former teammates struggle knowing he cannot help them with a match-winning performance like has done so often in the past.But Smith praised Australia for their 146-run win at Perth Stadium and the captaincy of Paine, who was made interim captain in the wakes of the Newlands episode before being handed the top job on a full-time basis.""It’s been tough (watching) at times, particularly when the boys haven’t played their best in a couple of games,"" he said.""It’s been hard watching and knowing that I can’t go out and help them.""But I was really proud of the way the boys played last week in Perth.""I thought they were magnificent and I think Tim Paine’s leadership has been exceptional since taking over as captain.""He’s obviously been faced with difficult circumstances to begin with but he’s done a terrific job.""Australia's first assignment after his ban lifts will be the 2019 Cricket World Cup and the Ashes in the UK.Smith outlined his playing schedule between now and the start of the World Cup but is not expecting to walk back into the national side as soon as he becomes eligible.Should he be picked in Australia's World Cup or Ashes squads, or both, Smith is ready for a frosty reception from the English crowds.""Hopefully (I will) get another opportunity to play for Australia,"" he said. ""And if that’s in a World Cup and Ashes, so be it.""No doubt the English crowd will be incredibly hostile and I’m ready for that if that was to happen. Nothing’s for certain, I’ll keep working hard and if I get that opportunity again that’ll be great.""One thing I’ve always done pretty well is blocking out exterior noise and getting on with the job.""No doubt the Barmy Army are loud and you can’t block out as much but it’s about staying in your own mind and not letting distractions take you over.""Smith had been expecting to feature in this year's Bangladesh Premier League, but has been barred from the competition on technical grounds, but will continue his globe-trotting T20 ways in the lead up to his suspension expiring.""I was playing in the Bangladesh league … then there’s the PSL and the IPL, which I think is adequate preparation for the World Cup if I’m selected,"" Smith said.""The way the one-day game is playing it’s almost an extended T20 so T20 cricket is a good way to prepare.""While Smith was banned for 12 months, he cannot hold a leadership position in Australian cricket for two years from the time the penalty was levelled.He was asked whether he had future captaincy ambitions but said for the moment his focus is returning to the national team. ""I just want to get back playing and try and contribute to the team as much as I can and just help out anyone who is around, Tim (Paine) and Finchy  (limited-overs skipper Aaron Finch) as well. We’ll see what the future holds.""But at the moment I'm just preparing to play and I'm excited by that prospect.""Between his club cricket duties, Smith has been working with radio identity Gus Worland as part of Gotcha4Life to help raise the awareness of mental health and help save the lives on men and boys in Australia.""The number of suicides in Australia is far too high; six men and two women a day for 25 million people or thereabouts, I think it's unacceptable,"" he said.""I'm trying to do what I can to create that awareness around it and that's what the campaign is about.""If you or someone you know needs support, visit https://www.beyondblue.org.au/",https://www.cricket.com.au/news/steve-smith-breaks-silence-scg-press-conference-ball-tampering-mental-health-suicide-awareness/2018-12-21?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

This is due to a cooling process during manufacturing, Apple told The Verge.And it’s true that iPads have become thin sheets of glass, aluminum and electronic components.

37366,Jayant traded from Delhi Capitals to Mumbai Indians before IPL 2019,"All-rounder Jayant Yadav has been traded from Delhi Capitals to Mumbai Indians ahead of Indian Premier League 2019. The 28-year-old, who had made his India debut in 2016, was part of the Delhi franchise since 2015, playing in just 10 IPL matches. The IPL trading window remains open until 30 days prior to the start of the 2019 season.",Times Now,"Days after the conclusion of the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2019 auction, Indian all-rounder Jayant Yadav has been traded from Delhi Capitals to Mumbai Indians. The Haryana all-rounder was a part of the Delhi squad last season but didn't feature in any game. The trade was confirmed on IPL's official website. Delhi Capitals and Mumbai Indians both strengthened their squad significantly in the Indian Premier League 2019 auction by roping several star players in their respective squads. While the IPL player auction was conducted on Tuesday, the trading window is still open which gives the franchises a chance to trade players among them until 5 PM (IST) 30 days prior to the start of the IPL 2019 season. Jayant is utility Indian player, who can be handy with both the bat and the ball. Mumbai, who bought Lasith Malinga, Yuvraj Singh, Pankaj Jaiswal, Rasikh Dar, Anmolpreet Singh and Barinder Sran in the auction, already have two good Indian all-rounders in Hardik Pandya and Krunal Pandya but Jayant can be a great back up option for the Rohit Sharma-led side. He has played ten games in the Indian Premier League and scored six runs while also picking up 4 wickets. He has also played 4 Test matches for India and scored 228 runs including a hundred and a half-century. He also has 11 wickets in the longest format of the game for India. He has also played a solitary ODI scoring a single run and picking up one wicket against New Zealand.  Earlier this year, Mumbai Indians had traded Quinton de Kock from Royal Challengers Bangalore ahead of the IPL auction. Jayant is the second player to have been traded to Mumbai this season. Mumbai looks a much more balanced team now with Yuvraj and Jayant strengthening the middle order. Malinga is back to spearhead the pace attack alongside Sran, Mitchell McClenaghan and Jasprit Bumrah. The spin pack will be lead by Krunal Pandya, who will be assisted by the young Mayank Markande and Rahul Chahar. Mumbai Indians Full squad: Rohit Sharma (C), Hardik Pandya, Jasprit Bumrah, Krunal Pandya, Ishan Kishan, Suryakumar Yadav, Mayank Markande, Rahul Chahar, Anukul Roy, Siddhesh Lad, Aditya Tare, Evin Lewis, Kieron Pollard, Ben Cutting, Quinton de Kock, Mitchell McClenaghan, Adam Milne, Jason Behrendorff, Pankaj Jaiswal, Rasikh Dar, Yuvraj Singh, Lasith Malinga, Anmolpreet Singh, Barinder Sran, Jayant Yadav",https://www.timesnownews.com/sports/cricket/article/indian-premier-league-all-rounder-jayant-yadav-traded-from-delhi-capitals-to-mumbai-indians-ahead-of-ipl-2019/334390?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

37369,"Facebook collects user data from dating apps Tinder, Grindr: Report","Facebook collected user data from apps like Tinder, Grindr, and OkCupid as per a report by German company Mobilsicher. The data reportedly included users' dating profiles and healthcare information and was collected via Facebooks Software Development Kit that lets users log in to third-party apps with Facebook. The report said data could also be collected from users without Facebook accounts.",Engadget,"A new report from German company Mobilsicher, an outlet dedicated to info on mobile security, has detailed some information about how certain apps share user information with Facebook, BuzzFeed News reports. The group tested the Android version of a number of apps -- including Tinder, Grindr, OKCupid, health-related apps like Pregnancy+ and MigraineBuddy as well as religion-focused apps such as Bible+ and Muslim Pro, among others -- and it found that personal information was being collected from those apps via Facebook's SDK. That information could include IP addresses, the app in use, the type of device and users' unique Advertising IDs, info that's transferred as soon as a user opens the app.Facebook's SDK allows developers to access Facebook Analytics and let their users log in with their Facebook credentials, and Facebook says in its policies that it can collect information through third-party apps that use its SDKs and APIs. Mobilsicher says at least some developers were under the impression that the information Facebook was collecting was anonymized, but even though users' names aren't attached to the data, the use of their Advertising IDs largely renders that a moot point. Mobilsicher says that as long as you've logged into Facebook on your mobile device at least once -- whether that be via a browser or through the Facebook app -- Facebook can link your Advertising ID to your profile.The findings follow a recent New York Times report that detailed how extensively Facebook shared user data with companies like Apple, Netflix and Spotify, and it's sure to add to the privacy concerns that Facebook has repeatedly stoked over the past year. Facebook's many 2018 privacy infractions include the Cambridge Analytica scandal, a security bug that affected millions of users and a Photo API bug that gave third-party apps access to Facebook users' unposted photos. While maybe not as egregious as some of Facebook's other issues, Mobilsicher's findings highlight, yet again, just how little control users have over their information and what Facebook does with it.",https://www.engadget.com/2018/12/19/facebook-collects-user-data-tinder-okcupid/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

37387,US doesn't want to be 'policeman of the Middle East': Trump,"The US doesn't want to be the ""policeman of the Middle East"", US President Donald Trump said on Thursday following his decision to withdraw all American troops from Syria. The US gets nothing ""but (spends) precious lives and trillions of dollars protecting others who, in almost all cases, do not appreciate"" what it does, Trump tweeted.",Reuters,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday defended his surprise decision to declare victory over Islamic State militants in Syria and completely withdraw U.S. troops from the country, amid criticism from some Republicans and concern from allies and some U.S. military commanders. In early morning tweets, Trump said he was fulfilling a promise from his 2016 presidential campaign to leave Syria. Echoing a central plank of his foreign policy - that he seeks to stop the United States being taken advantage of - he said the United States was doing the work of other countries, including Russia and Iran, with little in return. “Does the USA want to be the Policeman of the Middle East, getting NOTHING but spending precious lives and trillions of dollars protecting others who, in almost all cases, do not appreciate what we are doing? Do we want to be there forever? Time for others to finally fight,” he tweeted. The United States is also ending its air campaign against the militants in Syria, U.S. officials told Reuters on Thursday.     Trump had pledged to withdraw from Syria if elected, but the abrupt announcement on Wednesday to withdraw the roughly 2,000 U.S. troops from Syria caught U.S. lawmakers and others by surprise. The White House declined to offer a timeline for the departure.     Some of Trump’s fellow Republicans strongly criticized the move, saying they were not briefed ahead of time and that the move strengthened the hand of Russia and Iran, which both support Syrian President Bashar al Assad. U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, have told Reuters that U.S. commanders on the ground are also concerned about the impact of a quick withdrawal and were surprised by the decision.   Trump’s move also drew criticism from some U.S. allies, including Britain and France, which said Islamic State militants had not been defeated and that its troops would remain in Syria. The void left by the U.S. withdrawal could undermine diplomatic efforts to end Syria’s eight-year civil war and undercut the United States’ leverage in the region as well as leave it few options if Islamic State surges again.  “ISIS hits us they are doomed!” Trump tweeted, using an acronym for Islamic State.  Islamic State, which declared its so-called caliphate in 2014 after seizing large areas of Syria and Iraq, was down to its last 1 percent of the territory it once held in Syria and has no territory in Iraq, a senior U.S. official last week. But U.S. officials have warned that retaking territory is not the same as defeating the militants. In a campaign to defeat the group in Syria, former President Barack Obama ordered air strikes from September 2014 and then troops into the country the following year. Some U.S. lawmakers, including some Democrats, backed Wednesday’s announced withdrawal but said Congress needed to play a larger role in overseeing such military operations.  Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday welcomed Trump’s decision and said he largely agreed that Islamic State had been defeated.  Trump, however, said Russia - as well as Iran and Syria - were unhappy about the U.S. withdrawal “because now they will have to fight ISIS and others, who they hate, without us.” Democratic U.S. Senator Chris Murphy said Trump’s statements appeared in conflict: “Wait a minute... I thought we defeated ISIS. Why would Russia, Iran and Syria have to fight them if they’re defeated?” he tweeted in reply to Trump.

However, the retired pacer, who had not registered his name for the auction, trolled the fan back by writing, ""Hello champion, just a reminder, I retired from all cricket earlier this year.""",Times Now,"It was an enthralling Indian Premier League 12 Auction at Jaipur on Tuesday, with some intriguing purchases being made by the franchises.

37395,TikTok parent ByteDance sues China news site for defamation,"TikTok parent ByteDance has sued a Chinese news site for alleged defamation after it published an article accusing its Indian-language news app Helo of spreading fake news. The billion-dollar company said, ""by claiming that Chinese companies have influence over the Indian election the article constituted ""insult and abuse"". Helo had reportedly posted a story incorrectly quoting a Congress leader.",TechCrunch,"There’s worrying news from China’s online media world as ByteDance, the $75 billion company behind popular video app TikTok, is taking a news site to court for alleged defamation after it published a story about ByteDance’s  fake news problem in India.U.S. tech firms have come to rely on media to help uncover issues, but Chinese tech news site Huxiu has become the latest litigation target of ByteDance, which reportedly surpassed Uber’s valuation after raising $3 billion. The company has sued internet giants Tencent and Baidu in the past year for alleged anti-competitive behavior.This time around, ByteDance — which is backed by SoftBank’s  Vision Fund, KKR and General Atlantic  among others — has taken issue with an op-ed published earlier this month that spotlights a fake news problem on its Indian language news app, Helo.Launched in July as part of ByteDance’s push in India, Helo competes with local media startups such as Xiaomi-backed ShareChat and DailyHunt, as well as Facebook. ByteDance operates news app Jinri Toutiao with more than 250 million monthly active users in China, according to data services provider QuestMobile. TikTok, branded as Douyin in China, has a reach well beyond its home front and claims 500 million MAUs worldwide, with an additional 100 million users gleaned from its Musical.ly buyout.On December 4, Huxiu published an opinion piece that condemned Helo and ShareChat  for allowing misinformation to spread. One Helo post, for instance, falsely claimed that a Congress leader had suggested that India should help neighboring rival Pakistan clear its debt rather than invest in the State of Unity, a pricey local infrastructure project.In response, ByteDance filed a lawsuit against Huxiu, saying that the Chinese news site made defamatory statements against it in translating an op-ed by contributor Elliott Zaagman. Tech blog TechNode — TechCrunch’s partner in China — ran an edited English version of the story but it is not part of the suit.Zhang Yiming, founder of ByteDance, poses for a photograph at the company’s headquarters in Beijing, China. Photographer: Giulia Marchi/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesZhang Yiming, founder of ByteDance, poses for a photograph at the company’s headquarters in Beijing, China. Photographer: Giulia Marchi/Bloomberg via Getty Images“Technode edited the piece and removed some of my words. Huxiu was, and is with most of my articles, true to my original words,” Zaagman wrote on his WeChat timeline.To adhere only to “facts” as part of its editorial process, TechNode removed “colorful” parts of Zaagman’s article, according to the blog’s editor-in-chief.What goes missing on TechNode is what incensed ByteDance. Zaagman’s unfiltered statements on Huxiu “constitute an insult and abuse against ByteDance” by “claiming that Chinese companies have influence over the Indian election,” a ByteDance spokesperson told TechCrunch.“The content on Huxiu is obviously a rumor and libel. It’s malicious slander. Whether it’s Chinese or foreign publications, Chinese or foreign authors, they must respect the truth, laws, and principles of journalism,” the spokesperson added.The unedited English version is posted on Zaagman’s personal LinkedIn account here. Here is one paragraph that TechNode removed:Maybe still Zhang is simply a victim of his own success. Few entrepreneurs start a company expecting it to be worth $75 billion. But what he has created may have far broader ramifications. As is demonstrated by Russia’s use of American social networking platforms to interfere in Western elections, misinformation campaigns can be a tool used by adversaries to disrupt a country’s internal politics. At this current moment when China faces greater international tensions, a pushback to their rising influence in Asia, and territorial disputes along their border with India, the last thing that Beijing needs is accusations from an opportunistic Indian politician sounding the alarm about how Beijing-based Chinese companies are spreading misinformation among the impressionable Indian electorate….And this as well:Although, on second thought, maybe it makes perfect sense that Zhang Yiming is peddling products that he himself would likely never use. After all, any good drug dealer knows not to get high on their own supply.In a statement, Huxiu dismissed ByteDance’s accusation for being “wildly untrue” and bringing “major repercussions” for the online publication’s reputation. A spokesperson for Huxiu told TechCrunch that it hasn’t received any summons as the court is still processing the complaint.In a peculiar twist to the incident, Huxiu actually pulled its Chinese version of Zaagman’s piece days leading to the ByteDance suit. The removal came as a result of “negotiations among multiple parties,” said the Huxiu representative, who declined to share more details on the decision. In China, an online article can be subject to censorship for containing material considered illegal or inappropriate by the media platform itself or the government.The logo for ByteDance’s popular video app TikTok (called Douyin in China) at an electronic dance music festival. / Credit: ByteDanceThe logo for ByteDance’s popular video app TikTok (called Douyin in China) at an electronic dance music festival. / Credit: ByteDanceIn the U.S., Facebook  has responded proactively to issues raised by the media — for example by banning accounts that stoke racial tension in Myanmar — while Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey went so far as to suggest that journalists sniffing out issues on his service is “critical” to the company. Beijing-based ByteDance hasn’t commented on the fake news problem highlighted in Zaagman’s article, but staff from its Indian regional app previously acknowledged the presence of misinformation.“We work very closely with our local content review and moderation team in harnessing our algorithms to review and take down inappropriate content,” a Helo spokesperson told local newspaper Hindustan Times.[Update: Helo has recently partnered up with local fact-checking webiste Alt News as part of its effort to combat fake news on its app that’s available in 14 vernaculars.]The concerns about Helo are the latest blow for ByteDance, which has marketed itself as an artificial intelligence company delivering what users want to see based on their online interaction in the past. As has been the case with Western platforms, such as Google-owned YouTube,  which also uses an algorithm to feed users videos that they favor, the outcome can mean sensational and sometimes illegal content.Along those lines, ByteDance’s focus on AI at the expense of significant “human-led” editorial oversight has come in for criticism.In July, the Indonesian government banned TikTok because it contained “pornography, inappropriate content and blasphemy.” At home, Chinese media watchdogs have similarly slammed a number of the company’s other content platforms, and regulators in the country went so far as to shutter its humor app for serving “vulgar” content.But ByteDance is hardly the only tech company entangled in China’s increased media scrutiny. Heavyweights, including Tencent, Baidu  and ByteDance’s archrival Kuaishou, have also come under attack at various degrees for hosting content deemed problematic by the authorities over the past year.",https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/19/tiktok-parent-bytedance-sues-chinese-news-site-that-exposed-fake-news-problem/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

Police say 15 bottles of pesticides were added to the prasad while it was being prepared.The 52-year old seer and his three accomplices — a woman, her husband and his friend — have been charged with murder, attempt to murder and criminal conspiracy, senior police officer KV Sharath Chandra said.“Mahadeshwara Hill Saluru Math seer Pattada Immadi Mahadeshwara Swamy or Devanna Buddhi connived not only to take over the temple trust but also to defame the existing trust members,” he told reporters in Chamarajanagar.The seer was in control of the temple trust till 2017, but was sidelined later, which infuriated him, the officer said.On orders of the seer, the 35-year old woman allegedly arranged for pesticide and her husband and his friend mixed it in the prasad while it was being prepared, he said.15 died and more than 100 people are still in hospitals after consuming the poisonous prasad on December 14 at Sulvadi at an event to celebrate the groundbreaking ceremony for construction of the tower of the Kichchugutti Maramma Devi temple.He said the temple was under the total control of the seer till April 2017 generating huge money for him. However, at the insistence of local villagers and devotees, a trust was formed for expansion of the temple.“The seer was upset with the formation of the trust without his wish as his source of income almost dried up. Since then, shadow boxing between the temple management and the seer began,” he said.In October this year, the trust decided to build the ‘gopuram’ (tower) and revealed its plan to the seer, who readily volunteered and got an action plan for Rs. 1.5 crore from a temple architect in Tamil Nadu, he said.The seer allegedly planned to mint money but the trust discarded his plan, saying that it was a sheer wastage of money and prepared another for Rs. 75 lakh and decided to hold the groundbreaking ceremony on December 14, which irked him, the officer said.The seer directed the woman to mix poison in the prasad to defame the temple management and avenge his insult, the officer claimed.On December 14, the two men had poured 15 bottles of pesticide in the prasad after sending away the cooks, he said.The cooks returned and noticed a bad smell. They misled the cooks by saying that it was smell of edible camphor added to the prasad.(With PTI inputs)",https://www.india.com/news/india/15-bottles-of-pesticides-were-added-to-prasad-in-karnataka-temple-that-left-15-dead-3488653/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

He had written for the magazine for seven years and won numerous awards for his investigative journalism, including CNN Journalist of the Year in 2014.Earlier this month, he was named German Reporter of the Year for a story about a young Syrian boy.The cheating came to light after a colleague who worked with him on a story along the US-Mexican border raised suspicions about some of the details in Relotius's reporting. The colleague eventually tracked down two alleged sources quoted extensively by Relotius in the article, which was published in November.

The new round reportedly values the five-year-old startup at $3.3 billion. New investors including China's Tencent and hedge funds Hillhouse Capital and Wellington Management also participated in the funding round.,TechCrunch,"Naspers,  the South African investment giant, is back at it in India! Days after backing educational startup Byju’s by leading a $540 million investment, it has led a $1 billion investment in food delivery company Swiggy.The new round sees Chinese internet and Naspers ally Tencent join the party, alongside fellow new investors Hillhouse Capital and Wellington Management Company. Existing backers returning to take part in this round include DST Global,  Meituan Dianping and Coatue Management.The deal is the largest investment in a food delivery company outside of China, and it means Swiggy  is one of the few in the billion-dollar-round club. Others include Flipkart, which is now owned by Walmart, fintech startup Paytm, and OYO, which raised $1 billion from SoftBank’s Vision Fund, Southeast Asia’s Grab and others in September.Swiggy was founded in 2014 and it claims to work with 50,000 restaurants in more than 50 cities in India. That’s up from 35,000 restaurants six months ago, and the company claims it has doubled its GMV over that same period, although — like most private companies — it didn’t divulge specific data. Swiggy’s major geographical expansion saw it move into 42 cities in tier-two and tier-three India.The company said in a statement that it plans to use the capital for hiring machine learning and engineering talent, and further its AI technology to improve matching and discovery inside its service.Swiggy’s closest competitors include fellow unicorn Zomato, Ola-owned FoodPanda and Uber Eats, which came to India around 18 months ago.The deal is a real triple down on India and Swiggy from Naspers, which has just seen the valuation of Byju’s soar to some $3.7 billion up from under $1 billion last year; it first backed Swiggy in February before going back for more in June.You’d imagine that the Naspers link is also a major factor behind Tencent’s arrival. The South African firm is (famously) an early investor in Tencent and, despite a well-reported share sale this year, it still maintains around 33 percent ownership in the internet firm — that’s worth around $120 billion as of today’s share price.The deal takes Swiggy to $1.26 billion raised to date. That most recent June-round was $210 million at a $1.3 billion valuation. Swiggy isn’t disclosing a new valuation but Economic Times reports it as $3.3 billion.",https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/20/swiggy-raises-1-billion/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

37440,TN farmers mimic hanging themselves to object electricity project,"Tamil Nadu farmers mimicked hanging themselves from electricity transmission towers on Wednesday, objecting to an electricity project by Power Grid Corporation of India Limited and Tamil Nadu Transmission Corporation Limited. Farmers of 13 districts are protesting against it, claiming the construction of the towers will ""reduce the value of farming lands"" and affect their livelihood.",The News Minute,"In a desperate attempt to convey their anguish to the government, a few Tamil Nadu farmers mimicked hanging themselves from electricity transmission towers on Wednesday, objecting to an electricity project. Their opposition is directed at the Power Grid Corporation of India Limited for implementing the project and against the government of Tamil Nadu for being silent spectators despite the resistance.More than 4,000 farmers from 13 districts in Tamil Nadu are on a sit-in protest in eight centres across these districts since Monday.The project, carried out by Power Grid Corporation of India Limited and the Tamil Nadu Transmission Corporation Limited, involves erecting towers to facilitate transmission of High Tension electricity. This project was formulated to bring electricity from Raigarh in Chhattisgarh to Pugalur in Tiruppur district in Tamil Nadu and then take it to Thrissur in Kerala. The project was approved in 2014 by the Ministry of Power, Government of India at an estimated cost of Rs 1,500 crore.The farmers in 13 districts in Tamil Nadu, including Tiruppur, Coimbatore, Erode, Namakkal, Karur, Trichy, Salem, Dharmapuri, Krishnagiri, Vellore, Tiruvannamalai, Villupuram and Dindigul, are against the project alleging that the construction of electricity transmission towers will deprive them of their livelihood.Why are the farmers opposing the project?Speaking to TNM, Palanisamy, a farmer who is protesting against the project at the Kallippalayam centre in Tiruppur district, said that the power lines and the tower is detrimental to farmers like him. “The presence of a power transmission tower will reduce the value of farming lands. For example, nobody will give us loans based on our agricultural lands if there are towers on them, we cannot set up a poultry farm or dig borewells with such towers on our lands,” he said. He also stated that if they wanted to sell their land later, nobody would buy land on which transmission towers are erected.The protesting farmers also claim that the police officers who accompany the representatives from the company for measuring land use undue force on the people. They also accuse the police of manhandling women who oppose officials who enter their lands without proper authorisation.“This project is implemented under the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885, which says that if the people who occupy the land that is earmarked for a project oppose the project, then the land owners must give a letter to the district collector, who will then call each owner personally and conduct an inquiry, after which if he deems it fit, he will give entry permission in advance to the officers. Only with that permission can those officers enter the land,” claimed Rajendiran, a farmer who is protesting at Sulthanpettai centre in Coimbatore district.Rajendiran added that despite submitting many petitions, nobody was called for inquiry by the collector either in Tiruppur or Coimbatore. “In fact, one of our farmers had locked his land with fencing. Yesterday, a group of officials visited the farm and the DSP of Sulur broke the lock, facilitating illegal entry. When the women in the house opposed, they dragged them out and locked them in police vehicles. This is atrocious,” he fumed.Farmers claim that though ministers and officials agree that the project will damage their livelihood, they ask the farmers to give in for the sake of development.Palanisamy told TNM that the farmers in these regions have been up in arms against the project ever since work started in 2015. “We have been submitting petition after petition to all officers, from the local leader to ministers.

It was informational,"" the official said.The official also asserted that the US troops in Syria were to fight and defeat ISIS and not to fight Iran.""The troops that we had in Syria were never there to counter, fight Iran.

The BCCI is a very rich body, it can afford to send even 40 people down there. However, I feel that an India cap, an Indian blazer has to be made a lot more valuable. ... by carrying players and taking 19 players, I do believe that the selection committee has not handled their responsibility well,"" he said.""A lot of those players can come back and play domestic cricket which will not only embellish our domestic cricket, lift the standard of our domestic cricket but also give these guys, unlikely to be picked in the Test matches, an opportunity to regain form and make a case for getting back in the team,"" he added.The first one on the flight back home from Perth should be India opener KL Rahul according to Gavaskar.""He (Rahul) has no chance of playing in the remaining two Tests unless of course there is an injury to any player.

37473,Planets with oxygen dont necessarily have life: Study,"A NASA-backed study by researchers from US' Johns Hopkins University has found the presence of oxygen in a planets atmosphere is not necessarily an indicator of life. They simulated atmospheres of exoplanets and successfully created organic compounds and oxygen, absent of life. ""Even the co-presence of commonly accepted biosignatures could be a false positive for life,"" researcher Chao He said.",Times Now,"Washington: The presence of oxygen and organic compounds on planets may not necessarily mean that they harbour life, according to a study. In their search for life in solar systems near and far, researchers have often accepted the presence of oxygen in a planet's atmosphere as the surest sign that life may be present there.Researchers at the Johns Hopkins University in the US recommend a reconsideration of that rule of thumb.
Simulating in the lab the atmospheres of planets beyond the solar system, researchers successfully created both organic compounds and oxygen, absent of life.The findings, published in the journal ACS Earth and Space Chemistry, serve as a cautionary tale for researchers who suggest the presence of oxygen and organic compounds on distant worlds is evidence of life there.""Our experiments produced oxygen and organic molecules that could serve as the building blocks of life in the lab, proving that the presence of both doesn't definitively indicate life,"" said Chao He, assistant research scientist at the Johns Hopkins University.""Researchers need to more carefully consider how these molecules are produced,"" said He.Oxygen makes up 20 per cent of Earth's atmosphere and is considered one of the most robust biosignature gases in Earth's atmosphere. The researchers tested nine different gas mixtures, consistent with predictions for super-Earth and mini-Neptune type exoplanet atmospheres.Such exoplanets are the most abundant type of planet in our Milky Way galaxy, researchers said. Each mixture had a specific composition of gases such as carbon dioxide, water, ammonia, and methane, and each was heated at temperatures ranging from about 26 to 371 degrees Celsius.The team exposed the mixture to one of two types of energy, meant to mimic energy that triggers chemical reactions in planetary atmospheres: plasma from an alternating current glow discharge or light from an ultraviolet lamp.Plasma, an energy source stronger than UV light, can simulate electrical activities like lightning and/or energetic particles, and UV light is the main driver of chemical reactions in planetary atmospheres such as those on Earth, Saturn and Pluto.After running the experiments continuously for three days, corresponding to the amount of time gas would be exposed to energy sources in space, the researchers measured and identified resulting gasses with a mass spectrometer, an instrument that sorts chemical substances by their mass to charge ratio.The team found multiple scenarios that produced both oxygen and organic molecules that could build sugars and amino acids -- raw materials for which life could begin -- such as formaldehyde and hydrogen cyanide.""People used to suggest that oxygen and organics being present together indicates life, but we produced them abiotically in multiple simulations.""This suggests that even the co-presence of commonly accepted biosignatures could be a false positive for life,"" He said. ",https://www.timesnownews.com/technology-science/article/planets-with-oxygen-dont-necessarily-have-life-study/332862?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

37477,Mexico paying for border wall through new trade deal: Trump,"US President Donald Trump on Wednesday said Mexico is indirectly paying for his proposed border wall through the new US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). ""Because of the tremendous dangers at the Border, including large-scale criminal and drug inflow, the US Military will build the Wall!"" Trump tweeted. The US, Mexico and Canada last month signed the USMCA, which will replace NAFTA.",Daily Mail,"President Donald Trump on Wednesday claimed the military would build his border wall and Mexico would pay for it - indirectly under the new trade agreement.'Mexico is paying (indirectly) for the Wall through the new USMCA, the replacement for NAFTA! Far more money coming to the U.S. Because of the tremendous dangers at the Border, including large scale criminal and drug inflow, the United States Military will build the Wall!,' he tweeted.His declaration comes after the White House ditched its demand for $5 billion in funding for the border wall amid negotiations to keep the government open.  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell meanwhile announced that he was bringing a bill to the floor that would keep the government open until Feb. 8. It doesn't contain funding for Trump's border 'wall' — it only allows for fencing to be built in a continuation of the current government policy.The vice president reportedly told senators during a luncheon that Trump would sign the measure, if it passes, staving off a shutdown just in time for the billionaire president to jet down to his private club in Palm Beach for his annual Christmastime visit.President Donald Trump vowed he 'will win on the wall' after the White House signaled it was ditching its demand for $5 billion in funding for his signature issueTrump said the new trade deal means Mexico will pay for his wallThe GOP's top vote counter, John Cornyn, told CNN that Mike Pence affirmed that Trump would sign the bill that punts the debate over his border wall to next year.That bill has not cleared the legislative branch yet, however, and the White House did not respond to DailyMail.com's request for comment. Earlier in the week, the White House denied that Trump was mulling a short-term spending bill that doesn't fund his wall, but as a shutdown loomed the presiddent's spokeswoman indicated that Trump would sign whatever the Senate sends him. White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders also said Tuesday that Trump has tasked every Cabinet secretary to look through agency funds to see what if anything they can redirect to the border wall.Trump has claimed he could tap the military or use money that's reaped from his trade accord. There is nothing in the trade agreement that requires Mexico to pay for the wall. The administration is making a more nuanced argument that taxpayers and businesses will be saving money on goods and services that they will inject back into the U.S. economy. Sanders insisted on Tuesday that savings through the trade deal with Mexico and Canada would provide the revenue that would pay for wall. 'The President has been clear that the USMCA deal would provide additional revenue through that deal that would show that Mexico was paying for the wall,' she said.She added: 'He's saying that the revenue provided and the money that would be saved through the USMCA deal, we could pay for the wall four times over. And by doing that new trade deal, we have the opportunity to pay for the wall.'The agreement isn't even legal yet. Although the three leaders of the U.S., Canada and Mexico signed the trade deal, the legislative bodies in each respective country must approve it before its binding. None of them have done so. And there's no direct line of revenue from the agreement to the U.S. Treasury. Tax revenue generated by the trade provisions would not come from Mexico but from U.S. tax payers and corporations.A fact check by the Anneberg Public Policy Center found Trump's claim of indirect payment by Mexico to be false. The center talked to economists to see if the USMCA would provide enough revenue to pay for the wall, using a figure the White House released in January: $25 billion.  'Even if we accept conceptually the argument that government revenue attributable to the revised trade agreement constitutes 'Mexico paying for the wall,' there are no plausible assumptions of USMCA's impact that would see government revenue increase by $25 billion,' Geoffrey Gertz, a fellow in the Global Economy and Development program at the Brookings Institution, told the center. Trump previously has threatened to use the military if Democrats wouldn't fully fund his border wall. As commander-in-chief he can issue orders to the troops. But Congressional Democrats have warned that the Pentagon does not have the power to redirect funding to the border wall. The Constitution requires Congressional approval before money can be allocated and spent, which Democrat argues applies to this move.President Trump has also directed his Cabinet secretaries to look for funds that could be converted to building his border wall, which Democrats have also protested as illegal.Sanders said the White House legal team was examining if such a move could be made. 'That's their entire job is determining whether or something is legal and we are looking to those individuals to find out those specific pots of money that can be used for that,' she said at her briefing Tuesday. White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said the administration's legal team was looking into whether the White House could redirect funds to build the border wallTrump is vowing to fight for his wallIt's estimated it would cost $5 billion to build the president's border wallTrump also vowed on Wednesday he 'will win on the wall' after the White House signaled it was ditching its demand for $5 billion in funding for his signature issue.'One way or the other, we will win on the Wall!,' Trump tweeted on Wednesday morning as the clock ticked toward Friday's partial government shutdown.His protestation comes amid Congress' push for a two-month stop gap solution that would fund the government through February 8, which would keep it open through the holidays. Trump's tweet didn't offer any specifics on what he was looking for in a win and whether he'd want the money appropriated in any stop-gap measure or would be willing to wait and take up the fight again in the new year.The president tweeted twice on the matter Wednesday morning.An earlier tweeted suggested he had more thoughts to come with he wrote: 'In our Country, so much money has been poured down the drain, for so many years, but the Democrats fight us like cats and dogs when it comes to spending on Boarder Security (including a Wall) and the Military. We won on the Military, it is being completely rebuilt. We will win...'But he deleted that tweet and, six minutes later, offered a more succinct tweet: 'In our Country, so much money has been poured down the drain, for so many years, but when it comes to Border Security and the Military, the Democrats fight to the death. We won on the Military, which is being completely rebuilt. One way or the other, we will win on the Wall!'Lawmakers are scheduled to leave town on Friday and Trump is looking to go Mar-a-Lago for the holidays. Hopes were raised on Tuesday a deal would happen before Friday's deadline when the White House signaled it would be willing to accept less than the $5 billion that Trump has been demanding for his wall.'We will work with Congress if they will make sure we get a bill passed that provides not just the funding for the wall, but there's a piece of legislation that's been pushed around that Democrats actually voted 26-5 out of committee that provides roughly $26 billion for border security including $1.6 billion for the wall,' White House press secretary Sarah Sanders told Fox News. 'That's something that we would be able to support as long as we can couple that with other funding resources.'The president on Tuesday sidestepped a question on whether he was still willing to shut down the government to get his $5 billion in funding.'We need border security,' was his response.As for a government shutdown, Trump said: 'We'll see what happens. It's too early to say.'Republicans in the Senate pushed for a compromise that would agree to the $1.6 billion Democrats are willing to fund for the wall while giving Trump some funds to play with - thus giving the president a win in his retreat.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell proposed a bill containing the $1.6 billion for the wall along with a $1 billion so-called 'slush fund' that the president could use on boarder security. Democrats, however, rejected the offer. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnnell (left) and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (right) are working on a temporary measure to fund the governmentSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said his caucus 'would not accept a billion dollar slush fund' for the president. 'Leader Schumer and I have said that we cannot accept the offer they made of a billion-dollar slush fund for the president to implement his very wrong immigration policies, so that won't happen,' noted expected, incoming House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.A short-term funding extension, called a 'continuing resolution,' would let lawmakers avoid the images of a government shutdown at Christmas while punting the solution to Democrats, who take control of the House of Representatives in January. It would prevent the third government shut down this year after temporary closures in January and February during funding fights.  Any deal would have to be signed off on by Trump and lawmakers remain unsure exactly what the president would accept.The White House kicked the can down Pennsylvania Avenue to Congress on Tuesday.'You know, at this point, the Senate has thrown out a lot of ideas. We're disappointed in the fact that they've yet to actually vote on something and pass something,' Sanders said at the White House press briefing. 'So when they do that, we'll make a determination on whether or not we're going to sign that.' McConnell said he was sure the government would remain open.'Yeah I am,' he said when asked about it on Tuesday.  Trump on Tuesday said 'we'll see' what happens in regards to a shutdownFunding for the government runs out Friday at midnightMost areas of the federal government have already been funded through other appropriations bills. Roughly 25 percent of agencies are operating off of a Continuing Resolution that will technically expire early Saturday morning.Roughly 420,000 federal workers, including most law enforcement, would be deemed essential in the course of a shutdown and required to remain on the job. They would receive back pay in the event of a partial government closure, CNN reports.All other workers would be considered non-essential and sent home on an unpaid leave of absence. Congress typically gives them back pay for days missed, costing the government time and money for work that wasn't actually done.It can take weeks for the money to arrive, especially if the shutdown lasts until Democrats take control of the House the first few days in January, putting a financial squeeze on families over the Christmas holiday.  The Departments of Homeland Security, Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, State, Interior, Agriculture, Treasury, Commerce and Justice would be affected. ",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6511959/We-win-wall-Trump-vows-Congress-looks-short-term-spending-bill.html?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

He revealed that he could not tolerate his own voice in the initial years of his career.“Initially, I could not tolerate my own voice. When I used to hear my songs,  I wanted it to pass quickly. But then I realised that to do playback singing correctly and to know if I am making any mistakes or not, I have to listen to my songs over and over again. Only then I will know whether I am doing it correctly or not,” says Khan, who has voiced several Bollywood tracks.Khan, who has done playback for songs that were shot on several big stars, including Shah Rukh Khan, Salman Khan and Akshay Kumar, among others, does not have a favourite celebrity but says that he loved Akshay performed on his song, Teri Ore from the film Singh Is Bliing.

“Akshay did a brilliant job in Teri Ore. He acted so well that I could actually see the strain on his veins while he was performing. It was almost like he is actually singing the song. That was amazing,” says Khan, adding that Shah Rukh’s performance on Sajdaa from My Name Is Khan and Salman’s on Dabangg’s Tere Mast Mast do Nain are worth mentioning too. 
Khan, who recently released a romantic single called Dhadkane, also revealed that even after singing for so many years, he still considers himself a student when he records a track. “I tell myself that I first need to learn the song. I copy the expressions and then I portray it and interpret it in my own voice. Before all of this, it God's that I get my inspiration from,” he says.

37501,"Facebook let technology giants access its users' data, chats: Report","Facebook reportedly gave tech giants like Microsoft, Yahoo and Amazon access to user data through partnerships with them that exempted them from privacy restrictions. Microsoft's Bing could see the names of the friends of all Facebook users without consent and music app Spotify could read users' private messages. Amazon could access users contact information and Yahoo could see users feeds.",Engadget,"We regret to inform you that we may have published our article titled ""Facebook's terrible 2018"" just a few hours too early. Tonight the New York Times has once again dug into the social network and assembled -- based on internal documents and interviews with employees, former employees and business partners --an unflattering picture of the data it has been sharing for years with the likes of Bing and Rotten Tomatoes. Taken as a whole, these revelations make the Cambridge Analytica data leak revelations seem almost insignificant.Even with the last few months and years of revelations, the behavior described is surprising -- and not just for users. According to the article, companies like Apple and Russian search giant Yandex claimed to not know how much access Facebook had given them to user information. In the case of Yandex, the NYT said Facebook initially claimed the company wasn't an ""integration partner"" in October just months before telling Congress it actually is, and had access to Facebook's unique user IDs longer than others apps.It claims that Spotify, Netflix and the Royal Bank of Canada had access to read, write and delete private messages as well as see who was on a message thread. Apple had special access to phone numbers and calendar entries that the company said it was not aware of, while also leaving no trace that its devices were pulling in the data. According to a Netflix spokesperson, ""At no time did we access people's private messages on Facebook, or ask for the ability to do so."" Spotify has said it was unaware of this access, and Royal Bank of Canada disputed that it had such access.Microsoft had access to the names of Facebook's users friends and was apparently building profiles of Facebook users on its own servers, while Sony and Amazon could snag email addresses of a user's friends. Even the New York Times itself makes an appearance, with an app that was discontinued in 2011 still retaining access to users' friends list.The reporting confirms other things you may have heard before, like how Facebook pulls together information from outside sources to fill out its ""People you may know"" feature using so-called ""shadow profiles"" for people who don't have accounts.In response to the article, Steve Satterfield said ""Facebook's partners don't get to ignore people's privacy settings, and it's wrong to suggest that they do...Protecting people's information requires stronger teams, better technology, and clearer policies, and that's where we've been focused for most of 2018. Partnerships are one area of focus and, as we've said, we're winding down the integration partnerships that were built to help people access Facebook.""While we prepare for the inevitable apology tour, it seems unlikely that these revelations will go over well in the face of government scrutiny and increasingly-likely regulation. Mark Zuckerberg said in 2011 that the company's FTC settlement covered a period including ""a small number of high profile mistakes."" If those were mistakes, then what do we call the way it's continued to share data widely since then even as the FTC was supposed to be monitoring its compliance?Update (2:50 AM ET 12/19): Facebook has published a blog post responding to the article in more detail. In it the company said ""To be clear: none of these partnerships or features gave companies access to information without people's permission, nor did they violate our 2012 settlement with the FTC...We've shut down nearly all of these partnerships over the past several months, except with Amazon and Apple, which people continue to find useful and which are covered by active contracts; Tobii, an integration that enables people with ALS to access Facebook; and browser notifications for people who use Alibaba, Mozilla and Opera.""Steve Satterfield, Director of Privacy and Public Policy at Facebook:Facebook's partners don't get to ignore people's privacy settings, and it's wrong to suggest that they do. Over the years, we've partnered with other companies so people can use Facebook on devices and platforms that we don't support ourselves. Unlike a game, streaming music service, or other third-party app, which offer experiences that are independent of Facebook, these partners can only offer specific Facebook features and are unable to use information for independent purposes.We know we've got work to do to regain people's trust. Protecting people's information requires stronger teams, better technology, and clearer policies, and that's where we've been focused for most of 2018.

37503,Indoor sports training startup Zwift raises $120 million,"US-based indoor sports training startup Zwift has raised $120 million in a Series B funding round led by Highland Europe, to aid expansion in esports. Europes True, Causeway Media and Novator Partners also participated in the funding round. In 2018, more than one-third of the Tour de France peloton were Zwifters, Co-founder and CEO of Zwift Eric Min said.",TechCrunch,"Fitness and gaming have been two of the most popular categories of apps for years, and now a startup founded out of London that has combined the two in a unique way has picked up a big round of funding to capitalise on that. Zwift, an interactive platform for people to turn indoor cycling workouts into massive, multi-participant races, social rides, and immersive explorations of new domains, has raised $120 million — money that its co-founder and CEO, Eric Min, said will be used to expand to more training categories (its first steps outside of cycling have been into running), and to add esports tournaments.The funding — led by Highland Europe, with Europe’s True (not to be confused with True Ventures), Causeway Media and Novator participating — comes on the heels of very rapid growth for Zwift .The startup now has over 1 million registered accounts (it doesn’t disclose active users), up from a mere 200,000 two years ago, with users ranging from amateur cycling enthusiasts, people who cycle as part of fitness regimes, and professional athletes who use it to supplement IRL global training schedules.“More than one-third of the peloton in this year’s Tour de France” — despite all its controversies, still the gold standard for road races — “are users of Zwift,” Min told me. There are 200 Facebook groups built around Zwift communities, with people using them to organise rides and sometimes even to meet up in person afterwards at cafes, just as they might in actual outdoor rides. With customers in 100 countries, Min told me that there are on average 300 organised (group) rides a day happening on Zwift.The company isn’t disclosing its valuation, but Min said that the startup is “approaching unicorn status” on account of its growth and big ambitions and it appears to be more than $500 million with “a very small dilution” — a big jump on the $180 million Pitchbook estimated its valuation to be in 2016 (it’s raised around $166 million to date).Min believes that the upswing in e-sports could see the format getting ever-more mainstream acceptance. “Our goal is to bring Zwift to the Olympics,” he told me confidently.Zwift is swiftly addressing two different shortcomings of two common home pastimes. One of the problems with exercising at home — and specifically training in cycling as a first effort — is that it might get a little boring, and one of the problems with playing too many video games is that they contribute to the tendency we have in our modern world to be too sedentary.The service involves you providing your own bike, which you link up with a Zwift trainer (a rack-like piece of equipment that turns a bike into a stationary bike for indoor training), which in turn picks up your stats and adjusts tension and so on based on the course that you are riding. You cycle in front of a TV typically to get the immersive effect, linked up to a Mac, Windows or iOS App (it’s also on Apple TV). You start with a free trial before moving to a monthly fee of $15 (or $10 if you are currently on a trial or already subscribe: the higher fee was introduced last month).There are no plans at the moment for VR headsets or other head-based wearables because so far they have proven to be too bulky to be usable in the physical environment of sometimes-gruelling cycling, Min said. And for now, you also don’t use spinners or other stationary cycling apparatuses because these can’t provide the right kind of ‘real-world’ riding feel, he said. But this might evolve as Zwift partners with more third parties (and with companies like Peloton a big hit with home fitness enthusiasts, you can see how that might evolve).In all of its sports and sport ambitions, Zwift is bringing not just basic tension and gaming dynamics to the table: it’s using some interesting algorithms to help train its users, and figure out what might be the best logical step for them in terms of increasing or decreasing difficulty while measuring all other cycling stats. Min says this all starts with getting an accurate weight for each user.Cycling accounts for 98 percent of the company’s business at the moment, and running is just taking off. For runners, people use running treadmills, and that is the template the company wants to follow, eventually including rowing machines, step machines, and more. Sometimes the locations are actual places like Innsbruck, pictured above. Sometimes they are make-believe terrains, like the fictional Pacific Island Watopia, below:Min tells me he started Zwift out of London because that is where he lives, but much of the development has come out of southern California, since that is where there is a stronghold of gaming developers. Min himself is an expat from America (there are a lot of us here!), New York specifically, who previously had been a VP at JP Morgan and then founded a fintech company called Sakkonet Technology that’s still going strong, and he happens to be a cycling enthusiast going back to childhood.“I wanted to do something different from fintech and the idea for Zwift was staring right at me,” he said. “I was a cyclist since I was a kid, painfully so. The worst thing you could do is ride your bike indoors because it was so boring. I used all the products I could but it wasn’t engaging enough, so we thought, what about taking the tech that out there for gaming, combining that with what you do in cycle training, and bring all that to a digital platform? Even if you could get 80 percent of the experience, that would be better than what was offered in the past.” Highland and the other investors are all strategic, in that they are already investing quite a bit in other fitness enterprises, which could in turn point to partnerships down the road. Highland’s in eGym and Huel; True backs the Ribble cycling brand; and Causeway invests in traditional sports and esports.“Zwift is a fantastically innovative company and they are certainly leading the way in the indoor training space,” says Tony Zappala, Partner of Highland Europe in a statement. “It’s a highly scalable business and we’ve been impressed with how they have already managed to expand globally – already 70 percent of current subscribers are from outside the USA. Research points to an audience of 40 million competitive and enthusiast cyclists, and many of those lie in the traditional cycling nations of Central Europe, so in this market alone there is huge growth potential.”With numbers like that, even without widening the company’s remit, there is a large opportunity to build a specialist fitness/gaming business here, but from what Min says it sounds like this is just phase one of his strategy.Eschewing any comments about acquisitions when I brought up the topic in our conversation (“No acquisitions,” was his answer on that subject), he said that Zwift for now doesn’t have any formal commercial partnerships team in place.Even without that, there are about 50 gyms that are already building programs for their customers around Zwift rides, so you can see how this might develop if it did put more focus on partnerships with gyms, offices, co-working spaces or hotels in the future. “We want to build a business that will last decades, or more,” he said.",https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/19/zwift-which-turns-indoor-cycling-workouts-into-multiplayer-games-raises-120m/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

37507,President's rule to be imposed in Jammu and Kashmir after 22 years,"President's rule will be imposed in Jammu and Kashmir on December 20, after a period of 22 years. This comes after the Centre approved a proposal put forward by the state's Governor Satya Pal Malik. The state was under the Governor's rule since June 20, when BJP withdrew its support to PDP leading to the fall of Mehbooba Mufti-led government.",Times Now,"New Delhi/Jammu: The Centre is learnt to have recommended imposition of President's rule in Jammu and Kashmir after the expiry of six-months of Governor's rule on December 19. The decision has been taken after Jammu and Kashmir Governor Satya Pal Malik sent a report to the central government recommending imposition of President's rule in the state, officials said on Monday.The Union cabinet has cleared the proposal to impose President's rule in Jammu and Kashmir from December 19, an official privy to the development said. A communication from the governor's office was sent to the Union Home Ministry which moved the Union cabinet with the proposal for its nod.Now, President Ram Nath Kovind will issue a proclamation declaring that the powers of the Legislature of the state shall be exercisable by or under the authority of Parliament, another official said. The state plunged into a political crisis in June this year after the Mehbooba Mufti-led coalition government was reduced to minority following withdrawal of support by the 25-member BJP in the state.Since the state has a separate Constitution, in such cases, six months of governor's rule is compulsory under Article 92 of the Jammu and Kashmir Constitution, under which all the legislature powers are vested with the governor.The governor has to dissolve the Legislative Assembly after the tenure of six months is over and the state will directly come under the President's rule for following six months during which elections have to be declared in state. In case the elections are not declared, President Rule will be can be extended by another six months.No Presidential proclamation shall in any case remain in force for more than three years except for the intervention of Election Commission of India which has to certify that the continuance in force of the Proclamation is necessary on account of difficulties in holding general elections to the Legislative Assembly.Since the state does not come under President's rule under Article 356 of the Constitution and is promulgated under Section 92 of the state Constitution, all the decisions taken thereof shall have a concurrence of the President under Article 74 (1)(i) under which council of Ministers with the Prime Minister at the head will aid and advise the President.The governor on November 21 dissolved the 87-member state assembly after the PDP, supported by the Congress and their arch rivals National Conference, had staked claim to form the government. Simultaneously, the two-member People's Conference led by Sajjad Lone had also staked claim to form a government with 25 members of the BJP and other 18 unknown members. The governor had dissolved the assembly citing horse-trading and lack of stablity to form a government as the reasons.",https://www.timesnownews.com/india/article/centre-recommends-presidents-rule-in-jammu-and-kashmir-after-december-19/332627?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
37510,"3rd umpire gives batsman out, fielding team calls him back to bat",Brisbane Heat's James Pattinson was declared out by the third umpire despite appearing to be in his crease in the first Big Bash League 8 match against Adelaide Strikers on Wednesday. The 28-year-old started walking from the field before being called back by his opponents. Strikers' wicketkeeper Alex Carey later said they didn't think it was out after seeing replays.,Cricket Australia,"A sporting decision from the Adelaide Strikers, at the initiative of paceman Ben Laughlin, to withdraw a run-out appeal has helped avert a minor diplomatic incident on the opening night of the KFC BBL.Brisbane Heat captain Chris Lynn was left fuming after new recruit James Pattinson was ruled out by third umpire Greg Davidson in a close run-out referral during the hosts’ first innings on Wednesday evening.The verdict of 'out' on the Gabba big screen left players, punters and commentators alike scratching their heads, with television replays appearing to show Pattinson had marginally made his ground on the tight single.Umpires Simon Fry and Paul Wilson also seemed confused by the call and chaos momentarily reigned as Pattinson remained on the field of play and Lynn raged at fourth official Donovan Koch on the edge of the field.Adam Gilchrist later revealed on Fox Cricket that radio communication between third umpire Davidson and on-field officials dropped out completely after the 'out' decision had flashed up on the big screens.It took a sportsmanlike decision from Adelaide's skipper Colin Ingram to see sense restored, with Laughlin offering the idea to withdraw the appeal.""I'm not sure why it was given out, but I think the common-sense rule needed to come in, and we finally got there in the end,"" Laughlin told cricket.com.au after the Strikers' five-wicket victory.""I think it was our last option to get it done, so we offered to withdraw the appeal and we moved on.""I just went up to Colin (Ingram) our captain and just said, 'Mate, let's forget about this and move on'.""If it had been Chris Lynn and he was 200, I might've re-thought it, but we were in a pretty good position so it was alright.""Ingram said his side had just wanted to continue the game after a delay that lasted about five minutes.""It was a unique scenario,"" Ingram told Fox Cricket at the innings break. ""I ended up chatting with Benny Laughlin and he said, 'what's the option on withdrawing the appeal?'""The initial idea came from him, the good sport he is.""We could all clearly see it wasn't out. You could look like an idiot on TV if it isn't (out) but you've got to back what we saw and our boys were really happy with that.""We just wanted to get on with the game.""Asked if he'd seen an appeal withdrawn before, Ingram said: ""No, that's why I didn't know whether that was an option or not.""All you want to do is get the right decision.""I thought maybe he'd pressed the wrong button or something like that.""Strikers wicketkeeper Alex Carey confirmed immediately after the incident that they'd made the generous call to withdraw, agreeing that the visitors themselves didn't think it was out after seeing replays.""I'm sure you guys probably thought he was safe,"" Carey said on Channel Seven's broadcast.""What we could see on the big screen (was) that James was in, so Colin just told the umpires that we all acknowledged that we thought he was in and was free to bat on.""Everyone could see it, I'm not sure what was seen upstairs.""It made little difference in the overall scheme of the innings.Pattinson added only a further four runs after his reprieve before being stumped by Carey the following over.Brisbane soon slumped to 9-101 before wicketkeeper Jimmy Peirson (24 not out from 13 balls) and No.11 Mujeeb Ur Rahman (27 off 22) revived their innings to help set Adelaide 147 to win.The Strikers went on to claim victory in the final over.",https://www.cricket.com.au/news/james-pattinson-run-out-not-third-umpire-blunder-brisbane-heat-adelaide-strikers-highlights/2018-12-19?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

""I could find nothing else to wrap her body with,"" said Rajesh, who works as a cook. His wife was admitted to the hospital over a kidney-stone related problem when the fire broke out.",The Quint,"In a tragic incident, a 25-year-old man named Rajesh Yadav, was left with no choice but to cover his dead two-month-old baby with a doormat, after she was found in the charred bed of Mumbai’s Employees State Insurance Corporation (ESIC) Hospital, where a massive fire broke out on Monday, 17 December, killing eight.Rajesh was seen carrying the brand new doormat, outside the morgue at the Dr R N Cooper Hospital, where autopsies of the deceased are being conducted since Tuesday, 18 December, The Indian Express reported.Rajesh had married Rukmini four years ago, and they had been blessed with a baby girl two months ago. Rukmini had delivered the baby in ESIC Hospital, where during the outbreak of the fire, she had been admitted again due to a kidney-stone related problem, the report added.Speaking to the newspaper, Rajesh, who is a cook with Skygourmet Catering Pvt Ltd, said that after Rukmini was admitted to the hospital for kidney stones, he would take the baby girl to her in the hospital ward in the morning, so she could be fed, and pick up the baby and bring her home every evening, on his way back from work.On the day the fire broke out in the hospital, he had reportedly dropped off their baby to Rukmini around 11 am and left for work. Around 6.30 pm, he got a call from a doctor at Cooper Hospital – one of the Hospitals where the fire tragedy victims were being taken for treatment – and informed him that his sister, Dimple, who had gone to visit Rukmani, had been admitted.After rushing there and asking around, he located Rukmini at the Seven Hills Hospital- where she had been taken for treatment after becoming unconscious due to the fumes, the report added.In the midst of running between the two hospitals, he tried to find out if anyone had seen his daughter.Putting together the sequence of events, Rajesh’s uncle, Ram Prasad told the newspaper that when the fire broke out, the baby was in Rukmini’s hands but soon after the two women likely became unconscious on inhaling the fumes, and were taken out of the building by the rescue-teams, while the baby was left behind amidst panic and confusion.It took Rajesh a day to locate his daughter’s body, since miscommunication between the parents and the police led the latter to believe Rajesh was looking for his baby boy. As the couple mourn the death of their two-month-old daughter, Dr Rajesh Sukhadev, medical superintendent at Cooper Hospital confirmed to The Indian Express that both Rukmini and Dimple are now stable and out of danger.(With inputs from The Indian Express)(Hi there!

37517,Video shows 'fish rain' in Andhra Pradesh due to cyclone Phethai,"A video has surfaced online, showing a phenomenon called 'fish rain' in Andhra Pradesh's Amalapuram after cyclone Phethai on Monday. The video shows fish either dead or jumping in the puddles formed after the rains. As per the India Meteorological Department, this happens when strong cyclonic winds sometimes carry displaced fish from water bodies and drop them on land.",The News Minute,"Cyclone Phethai, which made landfall on Monday afternoon, caused havoc for the people along the coastal districts of Andhra Pradesh and officials there. The cyclone, which was accompanied by strong and gusty winds, has resulted in heavy showers across the state and claimed two lives, as it hit the coast near Katrenikona of Kakinada on Monday afternoon.But one occurrence that seemingly amused people was a strange phenomenon, which locals are calling “fish rain”, that happened after the cyclone. A video that has been going viral on social media since Monday evening shows several fishes either dead or thrashing about in the puddles formed after the rains, in what seems to be a residential area.The rare phenomenon reportedly took place in Amalapuram town of East Godavari. Though it’s commonly referred to as fish rain, experts have ruled it out saying that the phenomenon is possibly the result of strong winds that caused the fishes to get tossed out from water bodies and ponds.According to Dr NM Krishna, a Senior Research Fellow at the Central Institute of Fisheries (CIFT) in Visakhapatnam, such incidents occur when rains are accompanied by strong and high speed winds. He added, “Winds and aeration of water in fish habitats and ponds can result in fluctuation of dissolved oxygen (DO). When DO level decreases, fishes will try to move out of ponds and may get displaced by winds.”Dr Krishna further added that the pH (alkalinity of water soluble substances) levels can also show such impact.E Ananda Rao, Assistant Director of Fisheries Amalapuram, speaking to TNM about the reports, said, “We can’t say that it’s fish rain without any scientific merit, we are yet to examine what exactly happened.”According to sources, a resident of Amalapuram captured the video on his phone and circulated it among his friends, which later spread on social media.Watch video ",https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/video-it-raining-fishes-andhra-after-cyclone-phethai-experts-explain-93569?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

37519,Trump panel recommends guns in schools to counter shootings,"The Federal Commission on School Safety panel established by US President Donald Trump in the aftermath of the mass shooting at a Florida school earlier this year has recommended arming school staff. In its report, the panel also suggested hiring military veterans and former police officers who ""can also serve as highly effective educators"".",Times Now,"Washington: A safety panel set up by US President Donald Trump in the wake of numerous school shootings recommended Tuesday that schools consider arming staff, using veterans as guards and reversing Obama-era guidelines. The Federal Commission on School Safety panel, led by Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, was set up after the February massacre in Parkland, Florida, when a former student shot dead 17 people, sparking mass gun control protests.The commission rejected calls to increase the minimum age required for gun purchases, arguing in its 180-page report that most school shooters obtain their weapons from family members or friends.Instead, it suggested arming staff -- even teachers in some circumstances -- ""for the sake of effectively and immediately responding to violence."" School districts where police responses could be slower, such as rural districts, may benefit in particular, the commission said.It also recommended education authorities hiring military veterans and former police officers who ""can also serve as highly effective educators."" The report pushes for a review of disciplinary guidelines introduced in 2014 under former president Barack Obama, which suggested alternatives to suspension and expulsion to tackle discrimination against black and Latino students.The commission's report said the measure has had ""a strong negative impact on school discipline and safety.""

As much as 84% of the planes would be narrow-body and the rest would be wide-body, it added. Boeing also said that airfares in the Indian market are 10-15% lower than breakeven levels for airlines.",Reuters,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Airfares in the fast-growing Indian market are 10 to 15 percent lower than breakeven levels for airlines, a Boeing Co executive said, as the planemaker raised its long-term jet order forecast for the nation to a record despite market challenges. Major Indian carriers Jet Airways, IndiGo and SpiceJet were all in the red in the September quarter as high oil prices, a weak rupee and intense price competition eroded their margins. It is important for the sustainability of the sector that airlines show more discipline in pricing fares, Dinesh Keskar, senior vice president, Asia Pacific and India sales at Boeing Commercial Airplanes, said on Wednesday. “Double-digit growth coupled with losses is what I am concerned about,” he said. “I will forego 2 to 3 percent growth for making money rather than filling up my airplane at rock-bottom prices and never making money.” To date, however, the lack of profitability has not affected deliveries to Boeing clients, which include cash-strapped Jet Airways and budget carrier SpiceJet, Keskar said.  India’s passenger traffic has risen at around 20 percent in recent years, making it one of the world’s fastest-growing aviation markets. Boeing expects the country to become the third-largest commercial aviation market by the early 2020s. Boeing sees Indian carriers ordering a record of up to 2,300 new planes worth $320 billion from global planemakers over the next 20 years to 2037, about 9.5 percent more than its previous prediction of 2,100 jets until 2036 made last year. It said single-aisle planes, such as its 737 MAX, would account for 84 percent of global planemakers’ new jet deliveries to India over the period, higher than the world average. The forecast comes amid signs that pressure on the Indian airline sector, dominated by low-cost carriers, is starting to ease as oil prices fall and the rupee firms. Kotak Institutional Equities last week said in a note to clients that there were signs the worst was over, with data showing flat fares in the third quarter ending Dec. 31, versus a 9-10 percent drop in the previous two quarters. Carriers like Vistara, a joint venture between Singapore Airlines and India’s Tata Sons, IndiGo and budget airline GoAir are also turning to the international market in search of better returns. India has retained a Category 1 rating from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration that means its airlines remain eligible to add new flights to the United States and codeshare with U.S. carriers, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation said on Tuesday evening. Last year, India received a poor rating in an audit by the U.N.’s aviation body, sparking industry concerns that it could be downgraded to Category 2 alongside countries like Bangladesh and Thailand.

37522,"Indian drug regulators visit J&J facilities, take powder samples","Johnson & Johnson (J&J) has said that Indian drug regulators visited some of its facilities and took samples of its talcum powder. This follows a Reuters report that the firm knew for decades that cancer-causing asbestos was sometimes present in its baby powder. J&J also said Indian regulators have in the past confirmed that its products are ""free of asbestos.",Reuters,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Indian drug authorities visited some of Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ.N) facilities on Wednesday and took “tests and samples” of its talcum powder, the company said in a statement.  The visits came as regulators in India launched an investigation into J&J’s Baby Powder following a Reuters report last Friday that the firm knew for decades that cancer-causing asbestos could be found in the product. The company told Reuters in a statement that the facilities were visited by the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO) and some state-based food and drug administrations (FDAs). “Today, a few of our facilities were visited by the CDSCO and local FDA authorities and we are fully co-operating with them by providing tests and samples,” the J&J statement said. “The characterization of these visits as ‘raids’ or ‘seizures’ is incorrect as has been reported in some instances,” it said. “The tests have been conducted in the regular way that the FDA collects samples.” J&J added that the safety of its cosmetic talc was based on a long history of safe use and decades of research and clinical evidence by independent researchers and scientific review boards across the world. It also said Indian FDAs and the CDSCO have in the past confirmed that its products “comply with Indian standards and are free of asbestos”. Quoting an industry source with knowledge of the matter, Reuters reported earlier in the day that drug inspectors had taken samples of Baby Powder from its Baddi factory in the northern Indian state of Himachal Pradesh. A source at the CDSCO said its officials lifted samples for testing from nine Indian cities - Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata, Ahmedabad, Hyderabad, Bengaluru, Indore, Chandigarh and Ghaziabad. J&J did not immediately specify how many manufacturing plants the company has in India.  A CDSCO spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment. Surendranath Sai, a regional drug officer in the southern state of Telangana, on Wednesday said he would instruct inspectors to collect samples there. “On the basis of the news report, we are alerting staff to pick up samples. We will test them in a drug control lab here,” said Sai. “We will take action accordingly. Certainly we are worried because millions of babies may be affected.” Earlier, the Times of India quoted an official source as saying 100 drug inspectors had been assigned to examine different manufacturing facilities, wholesalers and distributors linked to J&J India, starting early on Wednesday. A health ministry spokeswoman declined to comment when contacted by Reuters. However, a senior official at the ministry said the report was worrying. “We are concerned about it and will take action,” the official told Reuters, declining to be identified due to the matter’s sensitivity. The official did not elaborate on what kind of action the ministry could take. A Reuters examination of company memos, internal reports and other confidential documents, as well as deposition and trial testimony, showed that from at least 1971 to the early 2000s, J&J’s raw talc and finished powders sometimes tested positive for small amounts of asbestos.  It also showed that company executives, mine managers, scientists, doctors and lawyers fretted over how to address the problem while failing to disclose it to regulators or the public. The documents also depicted successful efforts to influence U.S. regulators’ plans regarding limiting asbestos in cosmetic talc products and scientific research on talc’s health effects. J&J said on Monday it planned to buy back up to $5 billion of its stock, after $40 billion was wiped from its market value following the Reuters report.

Today, the audience needs something that is of an international class. Manikarnika is coming in the category of Avengers and Gladiator. If you see in the trailer, Kangana is seen cutting the head, we have done it subtly but it does give the feeling of Game Of Thrones. It's a real story and if you read the history, Rani Laxmi had so much power in her sword that she used to cut her enemy is two halves. We have matched all the facts historically. We have not fantasized anything, it's all real."" We are looking forward to the movie! What about you...Thats awesome!

Please no compare with fictional story.Why even compare? so petty.It’s ok promoting your movie, but please don’t compare your movie to Bahubali that movie was just a phenomena and entertained people of all age groups not to forget had unknown south actors with a massive huge budget.

The article carries a picture of former prime minister Indira Gandhi and some young men holding guns in Dhaka.Allowing the head of a banned terror group to contribute for a known media house has stirred a debate with journalists questioning whether the company in question allowed Saeed to write due to some ""direct links"" with the owner or under ""someone's pressure"".A court has ordered the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority to ensure that the Pakistani media does not display Saeed's pictures.

In April this year, the US placed the MML on its list of foreign terror organisations for its links with the LeT.The government has said that the MML is an off-shoot of Saeed's Jamat-ud Dawah (JuD), which has been declared as a foreign terrorist organisation by the US in June 2014. The JuD is believed to be the front organisation for the LeT which is responsible for carrying out the 2008 Mumbai attack that killed 166 people, including some Americans. ",https://www.timesnownews.com/international/article/indias-most-wanted-terrorist-hafiz-saeed-turns-columnist-writes-in-pakistani-newspaper/333129?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

However, with her ever increasing popularity and almost 197,000 Instagram followers she landed some huge brand deals. Brands like Vogue, Yves Saint Laurent, and Alberta Ferretti are flooded on her social media feed. With a creativity and determination like Noonoouri, Dior also wanted to be one of the first ones to use her in their brand campaigns.

We all remember when he went bald in response to a Maulavi's challenge following the Azaan controversy. Now, Sonu is in a tight soup and facing major backlash for his recent comments of being better off born in Pakistan. That's right! In an interview with India Today, Sonu made a pretty controversial statement.Sonu had said that he wished he were from Pakistan because then at least, he would get singing offers from India. He also stressed how Indian singers have to pay music companies to do the show whereas Pakistani singers are not forced to do that. Citing examples of good friend Atif Aslam and Rahat Fateh Ali Khan, Sonu stated that they were never asked to pay to sing at shows. Following the obvious backlash, Nigam took to Facebook to clarify his statement.Sonu started off by writing, ""Sometimes in an attempt to make headlines catchy and sensational, some journalists miss the real content. Yesterday's Aajtak Summit happened so amazing, and look what have they reduced it to... My point about being better off being born in Pakistan was about the music companies in India asking Indian singers to pay 40-50% of their concerts remunerations to them, and only then they'll work with those artistes.. but they don't ask the same from the singers from abroad, namely Pakistan..!""

Sonu Nigam is the most dishonest, hypocritical, fickle, idiotic, damaging human being. What you call GUTS is SHEER STUPIDITY. You obviously don't know him at all.Didn’t know Indian music industry taking share from concerts. 40-50% is bit too much. This is why Indian government should make rules for royalties.Yes, nowadays media just twist everything one say. But I am a bit curious about the payment methods. Why does not Pakistani singers pay to the companies? It can't be because the companies do them favors. They must be paid lesser, or have a different type of contract. Does this rule only work on the Pakistani artist, or is it the same for all other artist out of India?His points are all very logical and right, but media always highlights the Pak part not letting the real discrimination surface which these singers face, Lata has been fighting for it all her life, Mhmd. Rafi also achieved some success in getting rights, but overall its bad for singers.Movies make half or sometimes 90% business on songs, award/wedding/concert shows, etc. earn based on songs, and the singers/composers get nothing out of re-use of their songs and actors take away all money. Singers/composers should've been more wealthy.Same as writers issue in India, they dont get enough till Salim-Javed achieved some success, then Vijayendra Prasad inspired from the duo.And to add to that, discriminating against Indians in favor of Pak artists is worst kind of economic torture.He is absolutely right and mentally retarded journals they pick up only what could fetch TRPI'm sure you must be SONU NIGAM himself ....

Of cinema we are just about accepting female centric movies the audience has a lot of growing up to doWhat are you even talking about? TOH was far from being female centric or even female empowering.

37539,Elon Musk unveils his Boring Company's first-ever tunnel,"Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk on Tuesday unveiled the first underground transportation tunnel dug in Los Angeles by The Boring Company, a subsidiary of his space startup SpaceX. The over 1.83-km-long tunnel, featuring car elevators, was built for around $10 million, Musk said. ""Capable of travelling safely at over 150mph... it'll feel like teleporting within a city,"" he tweeted.",Reuters,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk made a brief public appearance late on Tuesday to unveil the first tunnel completed by the underground transit venture he launched two years ago as an ambitious remedy to Los Angeles’ infamously heavy traffic. Free rides were part of the grand opening.   In a 30-minute presentation carried by live webcast, Musk touted the newly finished 1.14-mile (1.83 km) tunnel segment as a breakthrough in low-cost, fast-digging technology being pioneered by his nascent tunnelling firm, the Boring Company. Musk has advertised the proof-of-concept tunnel as a first step toward developing a high-speed subterranean network capable of whisking vehicles and pedestrians below the “soul-destroying” street traffic of America’s second-largest city at up to 150 miles per hour. But such a system has a long way to go. The new tunnel was excavated along a path that runs not through Los Angeles but beneath the tiny adjacent municipality of Hawthorne, where Musk’s Boring Company and his SpaceX rocket firm are both headquartered. Musk, best known as head of the Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) electric car manufacturer and energy company, launched his foray into public transit after complaining on Twitter in December 2016 that L.A.’s traffic was “driving me nuts,” promising then to “build a boring machine and just start digging.” In May, the company gave the world a preview of the Hawthorne tunnel, posting a fast-forward video of its interior shot by a camera travelling the length of the cylindrical passageway, which measures about 12 feet (3.7 m) in diameter. On Tuesday, Musk put the total price tag for the finished segment at about $10 million, including the cost of excavation, internal infrastructure, lighting, ventilation, safety systems, communications and a track. By comparison, he said, digging a mile of tunnel by “traditional” engineering methods costs up to $1 billion and takes three to six months to complete. Musk boasted of several cost-cutting innovations, including higher-power boring machines, digging narrower tunnels, speeding up dirt removal, and simultaneous excavation and reinforcement. He also invoked his favourite comparison with a snail, a creature he said moves 14 times faster than the speed of a typical tunnelling machine. “Aspirationally, we should be slightly faster than a snail,” he said. Musk did not say how long it took to burrow his new tunnel, which ended up running short of the 2-mile easement his company originally requested for the project. But he showed pre-recorded video footage of a newly built elevator station designed to carry passengers from street level to the tunnel’s subterranean entryway. The video featured a modified Tesla Model X luxury car on the elevator. When fully operational, the “loop” system as Musk envisions it will consist of passenger- and automobile-carrying platforms called “skates” that can zip through the tunnels by way of electric power once they descend into the underground network. Alternately, he said, passenger cars could be outfitted with retractable side wheels allowing them to travel through the loop autonomously. Musk arrived at Tuesday night’s event in a Tesla vehicle so equipped, emerging from the car at one end of the tunnel - bathed in green and blue interior lights - as he was cheered by a small, enthusiastic crowd gathered for the presentation. Musk created a stir earlier this year by promising free trips through the tunnel once it opened. He made good on that promise at Tuesday night’s launch party, providing one-way trips to dozens of invited guests and members of the media.   If successful, the Hawthorne tunnel is envisioned as eventually connecting to a network of other tunnels, yet to be built. Last month, the Boring Company scrapped plans for a 2.7-mile segment under a West Los Angeles neighbourhood, settling litigation brought by community groups opposed to that project.  But Musk’s company said it was moving ahead with a proposed tunnel across town to connect Dodger Stadium, home of the city’s Major League Baseball team, to an existing subway line. In June, Boring was selected by Chicago to build a 17-mile underground transit system linking that city’s downtown to its main airport. The company also has proposed an East Coast Loop that would run from Washington, D.C., to the Maryland suburbs.

This comes nine months after an Uber self-driving car killed a pedestrian in Arizona and the program was suspended.",Reuters,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] received approval from Pennsylvania to resume self-driving car testing on public roads this week, state records show, nine months after it suspended the programme following a deadly accident in Arizona. A company spokeswoman said on Tuesday Uber has not yet resumed testing. In November, Uber said it was seeking permission from Pennsylvania to resume testing more than seven months after a deadly self-driving crash in Arizona.  Uber said last month that when it resumed testing it would do so with two employees in the front seat, enable an automatic braking system at all times, and more strictly monitor safety employees. Reuters reported earlier this month that after it received approval from Pennsylvania, Uber planned to begin driving “a handful” of cars on a mile loop between two company offices in Pittsburgh, where Uber first debuted its autonomous vehicles in 2016, company spokeswoman Sarah Abboud said. The relaunch is a dramatic downsize from Uber’s previous operation. The company in the past unleashed its fleet in autonomous mode on public roads at high speeds, after dark, in areas crowded with pedestrians and with a single backup driver in the front seat. This time, the cars will not operate at night or in wet weather, and will not exceed speeds of 25 miles per hour, Abboud said. The company has no plans to resume picking up passengers in the robot cars, a service Uber launched in 2016. In March, authorities in Arizona suspended Uber’s ability to test its self-driving cars after one of its cars hit and killed a woman crossing the street at night in the Phoenix suburb of Tempe, Uber’s largest testing hub. Uber also voluntarily halted its entire autonomous car testing programme.

Goa was a Portuguese colony for 451 years until December 19, 1961, when India liberated it.",India.com,"Remembering Goa Liberation Day, Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar on Wednesday extended out his greetings to Goans on this memorable day. The ailing Chief Minsiter said in a tweet, “On this memorable day, let us recall the valiant efforts of our freedom fighters who fought against oppression, and the remarkable role played by the Indian Army in liberating Goa from Portuguese rule. On this day, let us resolve, rededicate ourselves and united to keep our state clean and tidy, and to achieve progress and development in all spheres.”On the eve of Goa Liberation Day, Governor Mridula Sinha also took a moment out to recall this historic day. “Though Goan society had to face communal upheaval in the wake of Portuguese colonial policies, today Goa enjoys peace despite communal diversity… This demonstrates that strong religious identities and communal harmony can co-exist,” Sinha said in her address to the state.For the unversed, Goa was a Portuguese colony for 451 years, until the Indian armed forces liberated the coastal state from colonial yoke on December 19, 1961.Here is Why we Celebrate Goa Liberation Day:The first fight for Goa’s liberation from the Portuguese started on 18 June 1946 by freedom fighter Ram Manohar Lohia but it took 14 long years for the Portuguese to leave Goa. Yes, India got its independence on 15 August 1947 but Goa got on 19 December 1961. Finally, the 450 years of rule of Portuguese came to an end. And every year the nation celebrates Goa liberation day annually and various events are conducted across the state.Portuguese were the first ones to colonize parts of India and were the last to leave. The Portuguese invaded Goa in the year 1510 and subjected Goans to most extreme torture. From 1540, the bloodiest period of the invasion started off. Many Hindu temples were destroyed and prohibitions were levied on Hindu marriage rituals as well. Many converted to Christianity to get an exemption from taxes. Under the dictatorship of Antonio Salazar situation got worst. In his rule, people were denied basic rights as well. During 1946, when India was inching towards independence, Ram Manohar Lohia got involved in the movement to free the state.Operation Vijay began on December 17, 1961, when the then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru ordered the invasion. With a force of almost 30,000, the Indian attack overpowered the ill-prepared Portuguese 3,000 member army. With minimal blood shed, the attack was successful and was carried forward to retrieve the other Portuguese-controlled areas, Daman and Diu. At this point on December 18, the Portuguese Governor General Vassalo da Silva gave up control of the Union Territory of Goa, Daman and Diu. Three days after the attack began, Goa finally became a part of India.The people of Goa celebrate this momentous day with great excitement. A torchlight procession takes off from three different locations, coming together at Azad Maidan where people pay tribute to the martyrs who lost their lives while fighting for the liberation of the state. Post this, the celebrations take off with cultural events all around the state. From traditional dances by school girls to fairs, the celebrations don’t end until late evening.",https://www.india.com/news/india/goa-liberation-day-cm-manohar-parrikar-wishes-goans-heres-all-you-need-to-know-about-portuguese-invasion-3486554/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

37567,K'taka temple trustee hired priest to poison prasad that killed 15,"A priest has confessed to mixing insecticides in the temple prasad in Karnataka's Chamarajanagar that killed 15 devotees, police said. An officer said Himmadi Mahadeva Swami, the head of the temple trust, had allegedly hired him to poison the prasad to defame a rival faction of the trust who objected to Swami taking money from the temple's revenue.",The News Minute,"After the tragic deaths of 15 devotees who consumed poisoned prasadam at a temple in Chamarajanagar, the police have finally unraveled the plot involving rivalry and infighting within the trust that owns the temple.Investigators probing the harrowing incident say that a priest has confessed to mixing insecticide in the food, which was distributed as prasadam.On Tuesday, police arrested Doddaiah, a priest from a village close to Sulwadi, after he allegedly confessed to the crime. Doddaiah revealed that Himmadi Mahadeva Swami, the head of the trust, had allegedly hired him to carry out the deed. The Rampura police had previously registered an FIR against seven people in connection with the crime.“The temple was generating a lot of revenue. The trust is headed by Himmadi Mahadeva Swami of the Saaluru Mutt. He and his cronies within the trust planned the whole thing in order to defame their rival faction in the trust,” an investigating officer said.The plotThe Sulwadi Kicchu Maramma Temple is owned by a trust. However, its trustees were divided on various matters, which had led to the formation of two factions: one with Himmadi Mahadeva Swami and his cronies, V Madaiah and the temple manager Madesh; and the other faction with Khajanchi Neelakantha Shivacharya, the assistant manager P Gurumallappa, the secretary Shashibimba, trust members Chinnappi, P Shivanna, H Lokesh and N Keshavamurthy.Himmadi Mahadeva SwamiPolice say that the temple’s finances were steadily increasing and Himmadi Mahadeva Swamy had been allegedly pilfering funds. This angered the trustees of the other faction.“Chinnappi, Neelakantha and the others opposed Himmadi Mahadeva Swami pocketing all the money. They demanded that proper books be maintained. Chinnappi also began auditing the temple’s finances. This did not bode well with himmadi Mahadeva Swami,” an investigating officer said.In the October this year, Himmadi Mahadev, Madaiah and Madesh decided to construct a new gopuram for the temple. Himmadi Mahadeva had allegedly contracted the job at the cost of Rs 1.2 crore to his associates.“When the other members of the trust found out, they were not happy about it. The trust had only Rs 34 lakh left and a Rs 1.2 crore project was too much to handle,” the police added.Chinnappi and the trustees in the other faction allegedly obtained a new contract in December at a much affordable price, and had decided to organise a ceremony to mark the first day of the gopuram’s construction.When Himmadi Mahadeva Swami found that he could not control the members of the other faction, he allegedly decided to retaliate and defame Chinnappi and the others.“The plan was to mix the insecticide in the cooking water. Once the people ate the prasadam and would fall sick, then Chinnappi and the other trustees would be defamed. This way, the Swamiji could take control of the trust,” the police said.When Himmadi Mahadeva received an invite for the ceremony, he immediately contacted Madesh and his wife Ambika, and allegedly hatched a plot to poison the prasadam. The duo were responsible for procuring the insecticide. Madesh and Ambika allegedly handed over the insecticide to the priest Doddaiah of the Nagarcoil Temple in a nearby village.AmbikaOn the morning of December 14, Doddaiah allegedly came to the Kicchu Maramma Temple in Sulwadi. When he arrived at the temple’s kitchen, he saw that the food was already prepared.“Doddaiah arrived at the temple. When everyone was at the ceremony, he went into the kitchen and mixed the insecticide in the pulav. Not knowing that the food was poisoned, Chinnappi and his son Lokeah distributed the food to the devotees,” the police added.As news of the tragedy spread, Doddaiah rushed to KR Hospital in Mysuru, claiming that he had stomach ache. The doctors at the hospital did not notice any of the symptoms of organophosphate poisoning in Doddaiah. Hence, his blood sample was collected and sent for testing. Doddaiah, meanwhile, was resting in ward number 12 of KR Hospital.""The blood work came back on December 17 and that's when the doctors knew that Doddaiah was pretending to be ill. Soon we were informed and Doddaiah was arrested.

Now, a new study reveals the hard statistics on just how toxic the situation is. According to the report by Amnesty International and global AI software company Element AI, female journalists and politicians were abused every 30 seconds on Twitter in 2017.The study is the largest ever examining the way women are targeted with hate speech online. Some 1.1 million abusive tweets were sent to the women, which included members of US Congress, female UK MPs and journalists employed by a variety of political websites. Using volunteers, the researchers sifted through nearly 300,000 tweets mentioning one of 778 women on their list, and noted abusive content relating to gender, race and sexuality.The so-called ""Troll Patrol"" also found that black women were 84 percent more likely to be mentioned in abusive tweets than white women. ""Troll Patrol means we have the data to back up what women have long been telling us -- that Twitter is a place where racism, misogyny and homophobia are allowed to flourish basically unchecked,"" said Milena Marin, Senior Advisor for Tactical Research at Amnesty International.""We found that, although abuse is targeted at women across the political spectrum, women of colour were much more likely to be impacted, and black women are disproportionately targeted. Twitter's failure to crack down on this problem means it is contributing to the silencing of already marginalized voices.""The findings aren't likely to come as a surprise to Twitter -- the company has consistently publicised its alleged efforts in cleaning up the platform, with CEO Jack Dorsey recently appearing before the House Committee on Energy and Commerce to announce his intention to ""increase the health of public conversation."" Twitter is supposedly investing heavily in machine learning that will guard against abusive tweets, but as noted by the Financial Times, the platform remains guarded about the way its algorithms are trained and how abuse reports are handled.",https://www.engadget.com/2018/12/18/women-are-abused-every-30-seconds-on-twitter/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

""Jadeja could have been of more use than the fourth seamer,"" Manjrekar further said.",Cricket Country,"Mumbai: Former India batsman Sanjay Manjrekar feels India made a mistake in not including a front- line spinner in the second Test that Australia won on Tuesday at Perth to square the four-match series 1-1. He said the team management should take the blame for selections which have “back-fired.“(Australian spinner) Nathon Lyon is a great bowler, so we can’t assume that a Ravindra Jadeja would have been as effective as him.“But India, I think, made an error in going with four seamers, specially with Umesh Yadav and not Bhuvneshwar Kumar,” Manjrekar, an expert with official broadcaster Sony Pictures Networks, told PTI.ALSO READ: Virat Kohli and Ravi Shastri’s credentials must be assessed if India don’t win remaining two Tests: Sunil Gavaskar“If there was one spinner (in the team) there’s always cracks and roughs, especially with left-handed batsmen in the opposition, to exploit. Jadeja could have been of more use than the fourth seamer”, he said.“So, it was a selection error that may have also contributed to India eventually losing the match,” explained the 53-year-old batsman-turned-commentator.India crumbled in the face of Australia’s remarkable turnaround and crashed to a 146-run defeat in the second Test of the four-game rubber to squander the 1-0 lead gained in the series opener at Adelaide.ALSO READ: Lowdown of Ishant Sharma and Ravindra Jadeja’s on-field fight at PerthThe hosts levelled the four-match series after India were bowled out for 140 runs in 56 overs in their second innings on the fifth and final day.Lyon finished the match with eight wickets, including a five-for in the first innings, and was adjudged the Man-of- the-Match.As per experts, India had committed selection errors in the past, following which the team lost. “You don’t lose because of one factor and you can’t say that we lost because of poor selection.

Vihari, when you see him bat, you get an impression that this is a guy, who has a good technique.“His scoring shots are straight in front of the wicket and he seems calm temperamentally. He is clearly a batsman who has the game to bat at (number) 1, 2 and 3. So the sense is there having Vihari bat at the top of the order,” he said.The former right-handed middle order batsman said the team should not have high expectations from Agarwal, who opens for Karnataka.“Even if you play Mayank Agarwal, we should not have high expectations because it is extremely tough for an Indian batsman to straightaway go into a Test match on an Australian pitch, especially at the top of the order, where the Kookaburra ball does a lot.ALSO READ: Perth Test defeat equals India’s worst ever year, with seven losses“So, if India does not want to take that risk and put undue pressure on Agarwal, then Vihari is an option (to open the innings). But I will personally still go with Mayank Agarwal and Murali Vijay,” he said.Manjrekar said India does not have too many options when it comes to selecting openers. “He (Vijay) was pretty okay when he got that 20 (in the second innings) and we don’t have too many options,” explained Manjrekar.Young Mumbai opening batsman Prithvi Shaw, who sustained an injury while fielding in the practice game prior to the series opener, was Monday ruled out of the entire series.The selectors have named Agarwal as his replacement for the remainder of the Test series along with the fit-again all-rounder Hardik Pandya.",https://www.cricketcountry.com/news/india-vs-australia-2018-ravindra-jadeja-cannot-be-as-effective-as-nathan-lyon-sanjay-manjrekar-780523?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

Separately, SpaceX’s launch of a much-delayed navigation satellite for the U.S. military was halted on Tuesday, postponing for at least a day the space transportation company’s first designated national security mission for the United States.

37617,TN man undergoes surgery after brain tissue found oozing from ear,"Chennai doctors have successfully treated a 54-year-old patient who was suffering from a leak of cerebrospinal fluid from his right ear. Loganathan, who met with a road accident in 2010, complained of intense headaches and pain in his ear. In 2012, he was given ear-drops to ""dissolve"" the mass protruding from his ear until it was diagnosed as brain tissue.",The News Minute,"Since 2012, 54-year-old Loganathan, an accountant from Tamil Nadu’s Namakkal district, has been suffering from intense bouts of headaches accompanied by a sharp pain in the right ear. This would then be followed by a fluid discharge from his right ear. “Sometimes, the cotton ball in my ear would soak up all the fluid and some would even drip onto my shirt. I wondered where all this water came from,” says Loganathan.Loganathan, who met with a road accident in Erode in 2010, escaped with a head injury and a few months after the accident, he underwent surgery for tympanomastoidectomy (surgery to treat infections) in his right ear. This could perhaps have been the reason behind his intermittent ear pain and fluid discharge from the ear, opine doctors.In 2012, when Loganathan reported his condition to his doctors in Erode, he was given ear-drops to “dissolve” the mass in his external ear.In 2017, Loganathan’s ear pain and headaches intensified and this time, he had to deal with a constant, pulsating sound that he kept ringing in his right ear. “The sound would just not stop. It felt like I was living with two hearts - one in my chest and the other in my ear,” he shares.After much deliberation, Loganathan was referred to ENT specialist doctor K Krishnakumar, who works at the Apollo in Chennai, where he underwent another surgery recently. Dr Krishnakumar found that the mass in his ear was actually a part of his brain.Speaking at a press conference, Dr K Krishnakumar said, “I found that the fluid that kept oozing out through a hole in his ear was the cerebrospinal fluid, the pink mass on the external ear was a part of his brain and the pulsating sound was actually the brain’s pulse.”Fungus Cerebri, as this rare phenomenon is called, is an unusual term, given that there is no connection with the clinically defined fungus. This actually refers to the brain herniating into the ear, which occurs when a part of the brain is squeezed across structures in the skull and as a result, high pressure builds up within the skull.Dr Joy Varghese, Neurosurgeon at Apollo, who operated Loganathan shares that the condition could have worsened and caused severe complications if was not treated immediately.“The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) that surrounds the brain matter was the fluid that was dripping through his ear. Also, the pink and insensitive mass that was filling his external auditory canal was actually a portion of the temporal lobe. This could have caused severe infections in the brain if left unchecked. He was highly fortunate that he did not develop any complications,” he shares.After the surgery on November 26, which lasted up to eight hours, Loganathan was closely monitored for post-op complications. Dr Joy clarifies that the mass, which was removed from his ear, would not cause any brain damage to the patient.“In this case, the protrusion was a part of the temporal lobe, which is responsible for memory and emotions. The removal of this would not have affected the patient because it was such a small area and it had scars,” he tells us.Dr Joy also remarks that this could have been the first of its kind surgery in the country. “We checked available records of similar instances but while it is common for such prolapses in the middle lobe, cases of such a mass in the external lobe are extremely rare,” he shares.The doctors also stressed how unwise it would be to introduce an object such as cotton buds or Q tips, usually meant to clean the ear, especially since the ear is an extremely sensitive and tender body part. Its proximity to the brain and the thickness of its walls make it one of the most delicate body parts and any minor accident could pose danger to the brain. ",https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/tn-man-undergoes-rare-surgery-after-part-brain-found-oozing-out-his-ear-93592?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

He last donned the national colours when India toured the West Indies back in July last year.He has strained to perform at the domestic circuit. He was picked up at his base price by Kings XI Punjab (KXIP), the franchise for whom he started his career. Nevertheless, failed miserably in the previous edition. He couldn’t get going with the bat in hand as the veteran played at a strike-rate of below 100.

Some of them had helped spur growth in rural China by reforming land rights or establishing village committees.It also included those who dared to push the envelope in the early days of reform.For instance, a representative of a group of farmers from Xiaogang village in Anhui province, who banded together to subvert the Maoist-era collective farming system, was among the honourees.Jack Ma, founder of Chinese tech giant Alibaba, is among the world's richest people.But last month he emerged as a member of another club: China's 89-million-strong Communist Party, whose founding principle was the equality of wealth among citizens.The billionaire's Communist bona fides were revealed by the People's Daily, the party's official mouthpiece, in an article praising contributors to China's development.Jack Ma delivers a speech during a computing conference in Hangzhou in SeptemberMa, 54, is not the first nor likely the last Chinese super-rich capitalist to join the party, which counts property titan Xu Jiayin and Wanda Group founder Wang Jianlin among its billionaire members.But Ma's membership had not been widely known until now as China's richest man had previously suggested that he preferred to stay out of politics.Ma, a former English teacher and the founder of e-commerce giant Alibaba, returned to the top spot on this year's Forbes China Rich List with a net worth of $34.6 billion (£27.18 billion). People's Daily said Ma was a party member who has played an important role in pushing China's Belt and Road global trade infrastructure initiative - a pet project of President Xi Jinping.Ma is the founder of e-commerce giant Alibaba and has a net worth of $34.6 billionHe has also been honoured as one of the 'outstanding builders of socialism with Chinese characteristics in Zhejiang Province', where Alibaba is based, the daily said.Joining the party can be helpful to private businessmen and women in the country as they navigate a complicated business environment where the state-led economy dominates many industries and private business can be unwelcome.In China, company chiefs need the backing of the Communist Party to get rich, but they also need it to survive.It is a relationship that - when the political winds change - can hang them out to dry, experts say.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6507033/Alibabas-Ma-NBA-star-Yao-110-honoured-Communist-Party.html?ito=social-twitter_mailonline&utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

37626,Hackers use Twitter memes to trick users with malware,"Hackers used memes posted on Twitter to deliver hidden malware commands to retrieve user data from infected computers, according to Japanese cybersecurity firm Trend Micro. The hidden commands instruct the malware to perform various operations on the infected machine, such as capturing screenshots and collecting system information. The malware then sends the data to a command and control server.",TechCrunch,"Security researchers said they’ve found a new kind of malware that takes its instructions from code hidden in memes posted to Twitter .The malware itself is relatively underwhelming: like most primitive remote access trojans (RATs), the malware quietly infects a vulnerable computer, takes screenshots and pulls other data from the affected system and sends it back to the malware’s command and control server.What’s interesting is how the malware uses Twitter as an unwilling conduit in communicating with its malicious mothership.Trend Micro said in a blog post that the malware listens for commands from a Twitter account run by the malware operator. The researchers found two tweets that used steganography to hide “/print” commands in the meme images, which told the malware to take a screenshot of an infected computer. The malware then separately obtains the address where its command and control server is located from a Pastebin post, which directs the malware where to send the screenshots — 10/10 points for creativity, that’s for sure.The researchers said that memes uploaded to the Twitter page could have included other commands, like “/processos” to retrieve a list of running apps and processes, “/clip” to steal the contents of a user’s clipboard and “/docs” to retrieve filenames from specific folders.The malware appears to have first appeared in mid-October, according to a hash analysis by VirusTotal, around the time that the Pastebin post was first created.But the researchers admit they don’t have all the answers, and more work needs to be done to fully understand the malware. It’s not clear where the malware came from, how it infects its victims or who’s behind it. It’s also not clear exactly what the malware is for — or its intended use in the future. The researchers also don’t know why the Pastebin post points to a local, non-internet address, suggesting it may be a proof-of-concept for future attacks.Although Twitter didn’t host any malicious content, nor could the tweets result in a malware infection, it’s an interesting (although not unique) way of using the social media site as a clever way of communicating with malware.The logic goes that in using Twitter, the malware would connect to “twitter.com,” which is far less likely to be flagged or blocked by anti-malware software than a dodgy-looking server.After Trend Micro reported the account, Twitter pulled the account offline, suspending it permanently.It’s not the first time malware or botnet operators have used Twitter as a platform for communicating with their networks. Even as far back as 2009, Twitter was used as a way to send commands to a botnet. And, as recently as 2016, Android malware would communicate with a predefined Twitter account to receive commands.Gift Guide: The best security and privacy tech to keep your friends safe",https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/17/malware-commands-code-twitter-hidden-memes/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

Talking at an event, Gadkari said, “Ayodhya issue is not a communal issue and is not religious as well. Lord Rama is a symbol of our history, culture, and heritage. It has been proven that the temple was there. If Ram temple cannot be built at birthplace in Hindustan then where should it be? Crores of people’s sentiments and desire are that Ram temple should be built there.”The senior BJP leader also said that the issue is linked to India’s rich culture, heritage, and history. The minister also said this sentiment was earlier also in Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) agenda and remains at present as well.“There are three ways for it – matter is in court, it can be through mutual consent or by any decision in Parliament through 2/3rd majority. But I believe it should happen through mutual consent. our fabric is ‘sarvadharma sambhav’. it should be based on this,” Gadkari, who holds several key portfolios in the Cabinet, said.

At present, only loss-making national carrier Pakistan International Airlines flies directly from Pakistan to Britain. British Airways, owned by Spanish-registered IAG, will be the first Western airline to restart services to the South Asian nation.",Reuters,"ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - British Airways will resume flights to Pakistan next year after a 10-year absence that followed a major hotel bombing, becoming the first Western airline to restart flights to the South Asian nation. BA halted flights following one of the most high-profile attacks in Pakistan’s history, the 2008 Marriott Hotel bombing in the capital, Islamabad, which took place during a period of devastating Islamist militant violence that swept the country. But security has since improved, with militant attacks sharply down in the mainly Muslim country of 208 million people. In Islamabad, a web of road checkpoints dotted across the city for more than a decade has mostly been dismantled. Richard Crowder, the Deputy British High Commissioner to Pakistan, told reporters in Islamabad BA’s return was in large part due to “an improvement in the security environment in this country”. Pakistani officials hailed BA’s move, saying it will offer confidence to other foreign investors and make the country less isolated. “Once it gets around the world that British Airways has put its stamp of approval on Pakistan, it will put us one or two notches up as a country to do business with,” said Commerce Minister Abdul Razak Dawood.     BA, which is owned by Spanish-registered IAG, is due to begin the London Heathrow-Islamabad service on June 2, with three weekly flights by the airline’s newest long-haul aircraft, the Boeing 787 Dreamliner. At present, only loss-making national carrier Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) flies directly from Pakistan to Britain, but its aging fleet of planes is a frequent source of complaints by passengers. Middle Eastern carriers Qatar Airways, Etihad Airways and Emirates have a strong presence in Pakistan and have been eating into PIA’s dwindling market share. Turkish Airlines also lays on a regular service to Pakistan. Islamabad has been running international advertising campaigns to rejuvenate its tourism sector that was wiped out by Islamist violence that destabilised the country following the 9/11 attacks in the United States in 2001 and the U.S.-led war in Afghanistan. Pakistan was formed at partition at the end of British rule in India in 1947 and more than a million people of Pakistani origin live in Britain. Robert Williams, Head of Sales for Asia Pacific and the Middle East for British Airways, said the carrier believes the route “will be particularly popular with the British Pakistani community who want to visit, or be visited by, their relatives”. Zulfikar Abbas Bukhari, a special assistant to Prime Minister Imran Khan, said “British Airways coming back after a decade shows you where we were and how far we have come”. “Pakistan is becoming less isolated and more connected to the world, and that’s the Pakistan we want to see.” (This story corrects to clarify that BA flights will begin next year on June 2, not June 15, paragraph 7) Editing by Nick Macfie",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-pakistan-airline-britishairways/british-airways-to-resume-pakistan-flights-after-a-decade-idUKKBN1OH0T0?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

37654,"No settlement talks among Qualcomm, Foxconn in Apple dispute","Apples group of contract manufacturers including Foxconn are not in settlement talks with Qualcomm in the Apple dispute, according to the groups lead attorney. Qualcomm had sued the group last year over alleged non-payment of patent royalties related to Apple products. The group had then countersued Qualcomm for $9 billion over alleged illegal patent royalties.",Reuters,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - The lead attorney for the group of Apple Inc device assemblers seeking at least $9 billion in damages from Qualcomm Inc said on Sunday the contract manufacturers are not in settlement talks with the mobile chip supplier and are “gearing up and heading toward the trial” in April. The conflict is but one aspect of the global legal battle between regulators, Apple and Qualcomm, which supplies modem chips that help phones connect to wireless data networks. Last week, Qualcomm secured a preliminary victory in a patent lawsuit in China that would have banned sales of some Apple iPhones there. Apple later said it believed it was already in compliance but would change its software “to address any possible concern” about its compliance. But Qualcomm was also handed a setback in an antitrust lawsuit brought against it by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission when a judge said it will not be able to mention that Apple ditched Qualcomm chips for competing ones from Intel Corp when the case goes to trial next month. Qualcomm representatives did not immediately return a request for comment on Sunday outside of U.S. business hours. The group of contract manufacturers - which includes Foxconn parent Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, Pegatron Corp, Wistron Corp and Compal Electronics Inc - became embroiled in the dispute between Apple and Qualcomm last year. In the supply chain for electronics, contract manufacturers buy Qualcomm chips and pay royalties when they build phones, and are in turn reimbursed by companies like Apple. Qualcomm sued the group last year, alleging they had stopped paying royalties related to Apple products, and Apple joined their defense. The contract manufacturers have since filed claims of their own against Qualcomm, alleging the San Diego company’s practice of charging money for chips but then also asking for a cut of the adjusted selling price of a mobile phone as a patent royalty payment constitutes an anticompetitive business practice.  They are seeking $9 billion in damages from Qualcomm for royalties they allege were illegal. That figure could triple if the manufacturers succeed on their antitrust claims. Ted Boutrous, a high-profile partner at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP who is representing the contract manufacturers, told Reuters that statements from Qualcomm executives suggesting there were meaningful settlement talks with the contract manufacturers were “false.” “To the extent Qualcomm has indicated there have been licensing discussions with the contract manufacturers, they’ve basically made the same sort of unreasonable demands that got them to where they are right now, which impose significant preconditions to even discuss a new arrangement,” Boutrous said. In July, Qualcomm CEO Steve Mollenkopf told investors on the company’s quarterly earnings call that Qualcomm and Apple itself were in talks to resolve the litigation.  At a hearing in the case in San Diego on Nov. 30, one of Apple’s attorneys disputed that notion, saying there had not been “talks in a number of months. So the parties are at loggerheads and are going ... to have to go into trial.” Reporting by Stephen Nellis in San Francisco; Editing by Chris Reese and Himani Sarkar",https://in.reuters.com/article/us-apple-qualcomm/foxconn-not-in-settlement-talks-with-qualcomm-in-apple-battle-attorney-idINKBN1OG0AW?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

Addressing the reporters, Madhav said, “There is no vacancy for the prime minister’s post next year. Let all of them (opposition leaders) wait. Good luck to them.”He criticised Stalin’s remarks attacking the “fascist” Modi and his government in his speech in Chennai on Sunday and said “this kind of language is absolutely unfortunate. It does not behove well of Stalin.”At the ceremony for the unveiling of the statue of late DMK stalwart M Karunanidhi in Chennai in the presence of national opposition leaders including Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi, Stalin proposed the candidature of Rahul Gandhi for the post of prime minister as he was suited for building a new India and replacing a “fascist” government.On Sunday, Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) chief MK Stalin had said that Congress president Rahul Gandhi should be the prime ministerial candidate for Lok Sabha elections 2019.  “Rahul has got the ability to defeat fascist Modi government. Let’s strengthen Rahul Gandhi’s hands, let’s save the country,” had said Stalin.The DMK chief had also urged all political parties to join forces and support Gandhi to defeat the Modi-led Bharatiya Janata Party government.Lambasting the central government, Stalin had claimed that the country has gone 15 years back in Modi’s 5 years rule. “In the 5 years of PM Modi’s rule, the country has gone 15 years back. If we give another chance to him, surely the country will go 50 years back. PM Modi is behaving like a king, that’s why we’ve all come together to safeguard democracy and country.” However, other opposition parties had termed this decision as a premature decision.Notably, Stalin’s proposal came at a time when the Congress has been making attempts to stitch a grand alliance (mahagathbandhan) with anti-BJP opposition parties in its bid to dethrone the NDA government at the Centre.A couple of months ago, former Finance Minister and senior Congress leader P Chidambaram had clarified that the grand old party will not project its president Rahul Gandhi or any other leader as the prime ministerial candidate.  Another Congress leader and Thiruvananthapuram MP Shashi Tharoor had also said that Rahul would not be projected as the prime ministerial candidate for the upcoming 2019 Lok Sabha Polls.The saffron party had suffered a major electoral setback in the recently held assembly elections.

37662,Russia builds new barracks on disputed islands near Japan,"Russia has said that it has built new barracks on a disputed chain of islands near Japan. Russia plans to move troops next week into housing complexes on two of the four islands, known in Japan as the Northern Territories and as the Kuril Islands in Russia. Soviet forces had seized the islands at the end of World War II.",Reuters,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia said on Monday it had built new barracks for troops on a disputed chain of islands near Japan and would build more facilities for armored vehicles, prompting a diplomatic protest from Tokyo. Russia’s Ministry of Defence said it planned to shift troops next week into four housing complexes on two of the four disputed islands, known as the Southern Kurils in Russia and the Northern Territories in Japan. Japan’s defense ministry says 3,500 Russian troops are deployed on the two larger islands as part of a military buildup. The news came after the Kremlin said Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe might visit Russia on Jan. 21 as the two countries step up efforts to defuse the territorial dispute that has  prevented them from signing a World War Two peace treaty. In Tokyo, Foreign Minister Taro Kono told a regular news conference that Japan would lodge a protest.  Japan said in July it had asked Russia to reduce its military activity on the islands, a plea Moscow dismissed as unhelpful megaphone diplomacy at the time. “We plan to lodge a protest,” Kono told reporters, adding that Japan would clearly state its position during negotiations. “The premise of the upcoming negotiations is solving the island issue and concluding a peace treaty,” he said. Soviet forces seized the four islands at the end of World War Two. Russia and Japan both claim sovereignty over them. Despite the tension over the islands, the neighbors are discussing various other issues. At economic talks in Tokyo on Tuesday, the two sides said there was progress in areas such as energy and medicine, Kyodo news agency said.  Diplomats on both sides have spoken of the possibility of reviving a Soviet-era draft agreement that envisaged returning two of the four islands as part of a peace deal.  President Vladimir Putin and Abe have held numerous meetings to try to make progress on the issue.  Japan says it is concerned by what it regards as an unhelpful Russian military build-up on the islands - which has included warplanes, missile defenses and other deployments. Russia says it is perturbed by Japan’s roll-out of the Aegis Ashore U.S. missile system, part of Japan’s defense plans to counter China, North Korea and Russia. Russian politicians say they fear Japan might agree to deploy U.S. missile facilities on the islands if any are returned to Tokyo, and that Moscow could only countenance a deal if it received a guarantee that ruled out such a scenario. In the meantime, Moscow is fortifying the islands. Russia’s Defence Ministry said on Monday it wanted troops and their families to move on Dec. 25 into two new housing sites on the island of Iturup (Etorofu in Japan), and into two other complexes on the island of Kunashir (Kunashiri in Japan). Troops moved into two similar facilities last year and three more barracks are planned for 2019, the ministry said.  “Also on both islands we have modern and heated storage facilities for weapons and armored vehicles,” the ministry said in a statement, adding that more such facilities were planned.

But their wrath and hatred cannot stop Sunny as she knows how to ""protect herself"". Sometimes, she even has to answer ""judgmental as well as misogynistic"" questions thrown at her by journalists.She said: ""Each situation is different and I always like to give the journalist the benefit of the doubt, but I have worked up the courage to throw something back at them.

37685,Ford develops dog shelter that cancels out fireworks' noise,"Ford has developed a prototype of noise-cancelling shelter for dogs to protect them from noise of fireworks. Microphones inside the shelter detect the sound of fireworks and a built-in audio system emits opposing frequencies that reduce the noise significantly. Ford said that this is ""the first in a series of initiatives... that applies automotive know-how to help solve everyday problems"".",TechCrunch,"Dogs have a much wider range of hearing than humans, and noises that don’t bother us can give them a very ruff time. Fireworks are especially tough on many pups, and also hard on owners who have to calm their panicking pets. To potentially help them, Ford has developed a noise-cancelling kennel prototype that it says was inspired by the noise-control technology introduced in its Edge SUV to soften engine and transmission noises.When microphones inside the kennel detect the sound of fireworks, a built-in audio system sends out opposing frequencies that Ford claims significantly reduces or cancels the cacophony. The kennel is also built with high-density cork to further mute outside noises.The noise-cancelling kennel is not currently for sale, but Ford says it “is the first in a series of initiatives—called interventions—that applies automotive know-how to help solve everyday problems.”You might remember, especially if you have a small child, that last year Ford developed a cot called Max Motor Dreams to calm babies who only fall asleep in moving vehicles, a situation many exhausted parents (with high-mileage cars) are familiar with. The cot had small motors underneath that simulated the feel of a moving vehicle, played actual road noise and even had built-in LED lighting to mimic the glow of streetlights.At the time, Ford said the cot might be produced for sale if there was enough interest, but even though it went viral, Max Motor Dreams never did make it to the market. That’s not an encouraging sign for people who want to buy the noise-cancelling kennel, but in the meantime, here are some ways you can prepare your dogs for holiday fireworks. There is also a product called the ThunderShirt that is supposed to help alleviate anxiety in dogs, but of course results will vary from canine to canine.",https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/17/ford-comes-up-with-a-prototype-noise-cancelling-kennel-to-shelter-dogs-from-fireworks/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
