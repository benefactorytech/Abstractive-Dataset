19968,TN temple idol missing since 1915 found at ex-priest's house,"A nearly 700-year-old idol which went missing from a temple in Tamil Nadu's Melur was found hidden inside the wall of a house on Sunday. It was reportedly stolen by Kandasamy, one of the priests of the temple in 1915. The theft came into light after Kandasamy's grandson informed temple authorities that he suspected his grandfather had hidden the idol.",The News Minute,"An idol, which went missing from a temple near Madurai in 1915, was found hidden inside the wall of a house. It is believed that the idol is over 700 years old.According to reports, the idol was stolen by Kandasamy, one of the two priests of the temple in 1915. The temple is located in Nagaikkadai street, Melur near Madurai and is believed to be around 800 years old. Kandasamy took the idol to his house, after disagreement with the other priest. A complaint was also lodged with the British police back then. Though they had investigated it, they could not solve the case. Meanwhile, Kandasamy created a hole in the wall, hid the idol and plastered the surface of the wall.Six months ago, Kandasamy’s grandson K Murugesan, who runs a tea shop in Namakkal, went to the temple and said that he suspected his grandfather had hidden the idol inside the wall of his ancestral house. His suspicion stemmed from the fact that his grandfather used to offer prayers at that particular spot in the wall. He told the temple authorities that he feared that this act by his grandfather had angered the Goddess and had caused the deaths of many of their relatives as well as his bad health.Based on a written complaint from Murugesan, police requested permission of the house’s present owner to demolish the house and on Sunday, the operation was carried out. Upon demolishing the house, the lost statue was discovered at the exact spot mentioned by Murugesan.  It was a statue of Dhraupadhi Amman measuring around 1.5 feet in height. The description of the idol matched the records maintained by the temple including the fact that the idol has three eyes. The idol was taken back to the temple and a special pooja was performed.",https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/tn-temple-idol-stolen-over-100-years-ago-found-former-priest-s-house-100873?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

""That thought was very comforting,"" she added. Katrina, who was earlier rumoured to be dating Ranbir Kapoor, further said she had to ""break"" before she could rebuild herself.",Pinkvilla,"Katrina Kaif’s character of Babita Kumari in Aanand L. Rai’s Zero won her accolades and awards, and during an interview, Katrina Kaif admitted that Babita Kumari is a character that has come out of her real life. “Everything that I bring to my work comes out of my life’s experiences. I try to find a way to connect it with something I have seen, heard or something someone around me has faced,” Katrina informed Mirror.We all know that Katrina Kaif was in a relationship with her Jagga Jasoos co-actor Ranbir Kapoor, and after dating each other for a long time, the two called it quits, and when Kat was quizzed about how instead of breaking down she has come out as a beautiful person post her break-up, Katrina said that she had to take full responsibility and feel everything before she could proceed in life. Katrina said, “I had to break before I could proceed to rebuild myself. I had to unravel and feel everything that had happened...I had to take full responsibility for my part in the equation, what I could and should have done better and accept that the parts I was not responsible for were not my problem,” adding, “One thought that helped me when I was at my lowest, something my mom told me was, ‘So many women and girls go through the same thing, you feel you are alone but you are not.’”Talking about love and relationships, Katrina said that it is beautiful to be in love but make sure that nobody else has the right to your identity. “I am not saying be guarded in love. No, love with all your heart. Being in a relationship is beautiful and I have a lot to give to a person. But I now know that nobody else gives you your identity,” Katrina Kaif elaborated.

She got the taste as once upon a time she came between a couple who was seeing each otherAll the fandom have united against Katrina. See katrina fans what you have done to your idol by spitting venom and posting hate comments on each and every actress and actor.Kangana is Queen of Bollywood.She don't give a shit about these nepo kids like hritik. I am sure she will win national ward next year and she will be the first Indian celebrity to bring home an oscar.Ok kangana.Bebola fans stop degrading priyanka and ask her to treat her step daughter Sara nicely.Her step daughter is not a kid but a 27 years old woman. She can take care of herself.Lol kangana couldn't tolerate that Katrina is getting so much of limelight so she started commenting everyone about her and hritik.Kjo is it you and your nepo gang trying to defame kangana ? Be a man dude and do it openly. Don't be a woman. Though you are something in between.The comments section of this post is my favorite of all times! all Bollywood heroines have been invoked!! PV, please please keep this post alive and buzzing for a few days. Hahaha. BTW, Katrina you don’t worry sweetheart, you will have your happy ending in due course... lovePV please post. The comments section of this post reminds me of mahabharat scene of Jane bhi do yaaron! It’s so hilarious!Stop it shakuntela and pinkvilla girl. Go and die somewhere. Fans of flop hollywood wanna be.Shameless ranveer fans don't leave a single chance to abuse ranbir hiding behind Katrina and Deepika. It's not ranbir's fault that these most desired women in India are after ranbir and not you. You are nothing more than a joker. Your wife is still desperate to sleep with ranbir.Common hritik uncle accept that you were crazy after kangana and she dumped you.Calm down stalker kangana. Accept it he never dated you. It was all in your head as you were mad about him. if you dumped him so why hell bent to prove your relationship with him.Kangana never want to prove that. It was you hritik who said you will date pope than her. Those pics were real and you were running after kangana. In 2015 kangana won a national award for queen and gave an all time blockbuster twmr 2, she didn't need this old uncle to stay in news.Kangana always wanted to prove it. She lied about engagement. The pic was photoshop and misused. Her emails proves who is running after whom. Lol hahaha wins national awards still that psycho old woman only get attention and headlines whenever she talks about her Phantasy. Her ex too exposed her. So calm down kangana.
Post the truthThat photoshop photo wasn't false. When kangana posted the photo she photoshopped the people in it. So other people don't get to be the part of the whole drama. It's not like kangana took a pic of hrithik n her n photoshopped it together. It was a real pic. Only the people other than hrithik n her were edited out. N the reason she posted the photo was to prove that she was close to hrithik n she was invited to his close friend personal party. Which further proves that she dated him.Invited by a close friend at a party that too at a time when kangana working with her Phantasy, her photoshopping the pic later misusing it to support her lies and not providing her gadgets proves there was NO relationship. But him submitting his gadgets, providing copy of passport to prove she lie about Paris engagement, him releasing her emails and his family/ex/friends etc is enough to prove that he never dated or had any affair with her. Fear karma to accuse a man for no reason
Pinkvilla please post.The pic was edited and misused. Invited by Arjun not Hrithik. That too at a time when both were doing a movie . IRS normal to party with your coactors. It doesnt proves that kangana dated her Phantasy. Her emails shows it was in her own head. He was there with his wife .kangana had similar pics with her designers and stylists. Does it proves an affair? Photoshop and misused proofs there was no realtionship. Why she refused to give her phone and laptop? Kangana lied about it. See how can she have 7 yes of relationship with Hrithik when she had multiple relationships with other men . Hrithik proved there was no Paris engagement, pic is misused to fool ppl and she changed her statements many times. Infact, she stalked ajay ,rk in the same manner. Dont accuse an innocent man.
Truth should be posted pv plzHy hritik uncle, the post is about your crush Katrina stop bringing down kangana. You don't have any guys to call her in public but all you can do is write bad for her. #_phattu.Hi, stalker aunty, this post is about kat who dated your phantasy so stop trying to fool yourself that you dated Greek God. You don't have guts to speak the truth in public but all you can do is to take dig at all superstars and imagine yourself as Greek God's gf. #stalker
pv post the fact.Glad that you accepted that this oldie hritik dated katrina. But nobody came to know about them dating during znmd. He also dated kareena but again their are not enough evidences.He is good at hiding his affairs. Same way he hide his affair with kangana. In public he pretends to be a decent married guy but he slept with kangana, Katrina, kareena and Priyanka outside his marriage by promising them of marriage. But kangana is not like other actress and she calls a spade a spadeSo what? He is still single. He will marry your phantasy don’t worry..in her dreams although.Sad you still not accepting that Kangana dated Hrithik in her vivid imagination. Kat and kareena were interested in him. Infact kareena left kjo movie after he left saying she only signed because of Hrithik. Kangana is good at lying and stalking he never had an affair with her and its proved. In public she acts like a string woman bir desperately wanted to sleep with Ranbir and Hrithik. Broke another woman house. He never promised any if these girls marriage neither these girls are saint. Kangana needs help. She lied and created stories.
Pinkvilla post the truth please. Its importantKangana only speaks truth !If she speaks only truth then I m Queen of EnglandThat was sarcasm low IQ.......Oh by the way that 'Greek God' was left by his wife. Poor Greek God suffered severe injuries during bang bang. Poor Greek God is all alone and running after young actress. karma is hitting Greek god very hard.His wife had an affair with another man. Though she is back in his life. Dont make fun of injuries. Anyone can have it. Poor you. He is not running after any actresses but every young actress calls him hot and wants to work with him. KARMA hit kangana and you hard
Post this pleaseWhy his wife didn't value Greek God, why she left him for some other man. Because she came to know about his cheap tactics only after marriage. She may again leave him for another guy .Priyanka chopara is the biggest Bollywood icon ever. She is a matter of huge pride for India. Every American knows her name and respects her. She is a role model and she is still young and she will keep shining. Haters back off. Better concentrate on your favourite whose Hollywood career is done and dusted before it started.Okay Priyanka, you are really make us proud that our Indian women is crazy and desperate married a gora. You proved Indians are obsessed with foriengners.Priyanka's last film was way back in 2015. She played a supporting role in Deepika starrer Mastani . Nobody wants to work with Priyanka because she sleeps with every men from producers to directors to actors to crew members. Priyanka is old and given retirement from Bollywood. Deepika is the biggest female star and not that old flop priyanka.Katrina never went to Hollywood . So how can her Hollywood career is done and dusted? They re Katrina fans who is bashing PC because Katrina is the 2nd choice for Bharat.Fan war!!!Lol how ranbir get badnaam because of Katrina. Badnaam hone k lye naam hona zaruri hota hai.186 comments on kat posts are because of Ranbir. Surely he is popular and famous.Strange that 3 posts of Alia on Ranbir could not generate as much traffic!Okay ranbir now ask Neetu to change your diaper.Okay ranbir we believe you lolkatrina stop talking to RK in imagination.Third rate person Alia PR is in full force here leashing out on RK ex.Third rate person Katrina PR is in full force here leashing out on RK currentWish realtionship breaker and P Katrina would have spent more time in searching for her LEGAL father rather than chasing others boyfriend, breaking relationships, sleeping with ex and badmouthing other actresses and common people mothers. So she wont have to feign a fake fatherHow pathetic do you Deepika fans have to be? Seriously bringing her father along? You’re miserable and it is shown.this is why people have Deepika fandoms because of the shit things you guys comment on others personal lifeThese rk fans are the worst I have seen I'm not a fan of anyone but he's so puppy that every time he breaks up and move on like that doesn't affect him and throw shade over other person that they're clingy (ie) darling they're just being nice to you they're class ahead of you and your illiterate fam.during relationship he makes other person insecure I have seen many articles dp, Kat now alia is going through that. A spineless man is not worth a penny plus he did cheat dp with many models,when he was with Kat also he did make some moves kangana, mahira he hooks up with fans.. He is such a jerk modifies convo, twists it is that they're interested and hide behind bush so only kangana is calling out him and alia who is of course another cheater during soty she dated varun then jumped to rk. Not only rk,their parents also worst.Wow, RK sounds so much like my ex!Katrina stop accusing Rk. You and your parents the worst.PV, thank you for posting some really sensible comments. Beautiful and successful people can have self worth issues coming from childhood, can make mistakes and do learn life lessons like everybody else. Katrina, by being vulnerable, is helping herself and all those who idolize her. I have been through this and I fully understand what she means. And I know for how long I had put up a brave successful front at work while being abused in a relationship. Bravo Katrina. You will heal and you will grow.Wonder how Alia will handle all this when it’s her turn? Deepika was a little vulnerable in the beginning...and Katrina has been dignified so far....Dignity and Katrina are poles a part . She is anything but dignified. She played a PR game and defame rk.These comments are laughable and most of them written w the wrong grammar too. First off she was asked a question to which she replied and her answer was honest and elegantly point. Obviously she has gone through something pain and can share her thoughts on her experiences. That being said it was not negative or bringing someone else down like many others have. Everyone knows when ranbir and Katrina got together Katrina was the bigger star. This was 2007-08 and maybe the 12 year olds commenting weren’t old enough then to know but Katrina Kaif was the biggest female star in Bollywood. She was fresh off of namstey London which was her break through role and had a string of hits at that point. Everyone was Gaga over her looks! Ranbir included. Everyone heard the stories of him lusting after her. Think about it if she had cheated on Salman w ranbir do we really think Salman would still be this cordial to her ? Would Salman a family (his sis Arpita esp ) be this close to her still? Highly doubtful! Her and Salman had a cordial breakup evident from their friendship now. Salman was older than her and knew better. He knew he wasn’t getting married to her Bc that’s who he is. He made that clear and they ambicaly moved on. Ranbir led her on for 7 long years. He pretended to love her and maybe he did to some extent but not that genuine true love which is what she expressed for him. Ranbir when he first got w her won the ultimate prize. Hot superstar girl friend and was infatuated w her. But obv infatuation only lasts so long. I think the issue w Katrina was her unstable past upbringing and she prob did not have a strong sense of self so she kept taking ranbir back despite issues. She seems like she needed to go through this w him in order to realize her own worth. I think she came out a stronger confident person in the end. And there’s a diff btwn dating a random girls ex and your friends ex ala deepika and Alia ! Not saying what Katrina did to deepik was good Bc it was not. But she wasn’t friends w deepika at that time. Alia was katrinas friend. That is the worst betrayal. Though Katrina was shady to hook up w ranbir while he was w dpad. The worst in all of this and who often goes unscathed is Ranbir Kapoor. He is a jerk !I am a 1998 born out I was in class 3rd when Katrina's song just chill chill came and it was so popular and she became everyone's fav with that song. Then I remember Singh is king, how everyone in my class discusses about Katrina then came my fav apkgk and since apkgk I have watched all her films. I remember her craze.Point out where she was asked about Ranbir ? She did cheated Salman which is confirmed by him. He forgives her that another story. Salman never insulted any of his girl in public expect Katrina. . Also there is no smoke without fire. Google it and see the reason of their breakup. Infact he took a dig at her at an interview and in a movie too. Why would he do that? He said he wanted to marry her in an interview and at his sister wedding.
Katrina broke Dp so what she wasnt her friend? Alia didnt broke Katrina relationship with Ranbir. But Katrina is responsible for breaking rkdp . Who said you can hurt another girl if you are not friendly with her? Stupid logic. What betrayal? He dated Mahira before alia. Where it's written you cant date your friends ex? It's not as worst compare to what Katrina did to Deepika and Salman.It’s comment like this that make me not even want to come to link villa
Any more. Illogical comments. The original poster made valid comments - there is a adiffernce in dating a friends boyfriend and someone who you don’t know well boyfriend. Katrina was friends w Alia , no matter how long ranbir and Katrina were broken up you don’t do that to another friend. Especially when you know the heartbreak behind the romance which Alia definitely knew! What Katrina did to deepika was wrong no doubt if she really did steal him from deepika and her not knowing deepik well doesn’t excuse it or make it better. That being said it’s still a hundred times worse coming from a friend (Alia), that’s someone you trusted. I think regardless Katrina deepika both got lucky. Ranbir is not a good person. And his family seems the worst. Alia should run while she can Bc whoever ends up w him
And that family is stuckTotally on point. PV please post. This is a mature, experienced person, not some silly PR troll. Quite frankly, narcissists like Ranbir pay their price very very late in life if at all. Otherwise they keep moving from one shiny target to another Deeoika, Katrina, Nahira, Alia!ALIA BHATT please stop posting anonymous comments.. You are just so insecure of Katrina.. You are writing stuff as you think Ranbir kapoor reads pinkvilla comments and gets in relationship based on that.. Read you tube.. How ill people think about Alia.. U are just a kid who wants to get laid with RanbirIts ranbir kapoor who is posting these comments he spend most time in gossipsThat's too personal ahhh!!! I'm heartbrokenKATRINA TURQUOTE please stop posting comments abusing Alia. You are insecure and jealous of Alia. . Look what people think about you. A cheater and a user who is desperate for Ranbir
Post be fairThats so lame chopra.You are throwing dirt on other women character. What about your new year trip with ranbir in 2010. You both definitely shared bed in that trip.Most of the hate comments here are by Priyanka chopara fans, they do it to start a fanwar between Katrina and Deepika.It's funny how sunny Leone, Poonam Pandey, ritik, kangana, Anushka,virat, alia and even st/sc people are discussed here.Hritik definitely dated kangana. If everything is in kangana's head then why she didn't spread those rumours about other actors like khans why only hritik. He wanted to have only a physical relationship with kangana and kangana dumped him.Haha ok kangana. If it was true so why photoshop a pic and lie about engagement? In order to dumped one need to be in a relationship. Haha.For people blaming Katrina’s past and why she is speaking now - other people who have been through abusive cheating relationships fully understand her. If she did not have the past she had and had a strong emotional backbone, she would have kicked RK out in a year! She went through what was her lesson in self worth and will only learn from it. She has a right to speak about it. Many many ppl who go through such things speak up, write blog posts, etc. it’s healing and it’s inspirational . PV pls postWell written.so apt.She is looking like a Barbie doll in that picture.I am totally loving to see stsc people getting frustrated about Katrina. According to them Katrina is undeserving because she is not a very good actress. But if we can have undeserving stsc people in best positions then why shouldn't we have Katrina in bollywood. Katrina should be there for another one decade and may these stsc people get more frustratimed about her. The hate and frustration stsc people are feeling here for Katrina is same that we feel for you guys eating our opportunities.It's only for media questions they act as emotional and that too when their film is coming. They keep dating new people everywhere and enjoy their luxurious life.She is allowed to talk about her life! WHY NOT! Just because youindians can spew abuses she needs to shut up? WOW double standards. Your little shorty uglyslut alia can go around publicly saying she is sleepingwith RK but katrina can't tell her story? !So Alia cant talk about her boyfriend but tall ugly skit kat can speak about her ex . Double standard. Why bash Dp when she told her story? Post pv be fairNiceSorry to hear your pain of not marrying the Kapoor guy. To be frank, I personally never felt he was committed or in love with you. Shame you came in between Deepika and Ranbir. They were the best couple, completing each other. Even now we can see, feel something between them. They were made for each other. Hope you meet someone who will truly love you.One - Ranbir did not love Deepika. He is only interested in her now coz she is successful as with his rival. Two - people like Ranbir easily convince their new lovers that they are broken up with an ex and she is being clingy. This is what RK did to Katrina convincing her that Deepika and he was long over. He let Deepika blame Katrina for years and kept his friendship with Deepika. He is a snake - asteen ka saanp. Pic pls postPerpetrator kat acting like a victim. Slow claps.Katrina is sunny leone of Bollywood.Sunny Leone is the most beautiful women in India and one of the most sexiest woman in the world. Bollywood never had hot as hell stunning actress like sunny Leone. No need of dragging her down.Is that a compliment or ??????Katrina fans who are abusing Alia has forgot what Katrina did to Deepika and Salman. About her indecent past, her being an illegal child and how she tried to break ilulia relationship with Salman, how desperately she went for vickey breaking his relationship and how she two times her bfs. Lol
Post pinkvillaKatrina! Don't milk this. Your silence is golden. It's the silence that gave u dignity. As a fan don't talk about Ranbir, Alia n Salman. Talk about playing cricket n the movie. The PRs r waiting daily to destroy u. One of the reason race 3 failed is be because the media created a negative perception before the release. N that is why Salman is surprising with bharat. Ranbir n KJo n Alia PR r just waiting any article on u to release n abuse u. Ranbir is facing his karma. So is Alia. You eat popcorn.Look at the disgusting comment section.Some of the people are making fun of periods too.Not only Katrina but every woman gets that including your mother too that's why she gave birth to a jerk like you.Guys none of them are saint. Ranbir cheated on DP, DP started dating RS when he was dating Anu, Katrina cheated on Salman and shamelessly went back tk him for work..aur Alia ki to baat hi kuch alaag hai. For the stars only money and success matters, relationships have no value in their world..

It must have been heartbreaking. It’s a betrayal of the highest order. But Kat has definitely come out a stronger person, u can see it in her persona and the way she carries herself now. It may have been a temporary setback but she gained a lifetime of experience n strength.What about Katrina breaking Deepika relationship with Ranbir? Her cheating Salman and Two timing Ranbir with Gruthik? Isn't that horrible and heartbreaking? It's also a betrayal. So Katrina is caught by KARMA. Dont show her as a victim and bechari. Before Alia, he dated MahiraAlia bhatts is poonampandey of btown LolKatrina turquote is sunny lenone of brown lolTell your mother to use some deo for her smelly V.....Desperate Alia bhatts..

Nobody likes her.. She is a BITCH with a bastard..shedeserves Ranbir for that matter she can spread her legs for karan johar also.. He nepopapa.. She is a bhatts after all.. We all know their historyYour life must be so pathetic that you can only get satisfaction by calling people whom you don't know in real life names. Katrina is having her karma.Katrina PR chill. Look at Katrina's and her family history of being a P in UK. Look how she slept with Ranbir despite being bhai girlfriend. Then spread her legs for duggu when she was with Ranbir. Everyone knows about Katrina's past and her not aware of her real father . She is a BITCH and a user soul . She deserves to be hated and can spread her legs for Ali.
Be fair to postPinkvilla Hates Katrina for sure100 comments in an hour wow
Power and stardom of ranbir Kapoor.Going Deepika’s way to find success by making emotional fool of everyoneIt's about Katrina and Alia.. Deepika is happily married.. Andaliaisslutforsure.. Bhatts family has huge history of producing slits.. And raising them. She is one of the desperate slut this Alia.. SucksDeepika didnt get success and make anyone an emotional fool. She speaks the truth . She got successful because of hardworking and talent.#vatanaEveryone blaming alia but what about katrina and hrithik affair during bang bang? It's well known, katrina can't ressist successful man, vicky kaushal is now on her list.That's a lie. From 2013 hritik is dating only kangana though kangana dumped her 'silly ex' in 2016.Dont lie Katrina it's a fact. It's also proved that Hrithik never dated Kangana. It was in her imagination. Sallu confirmed your affair with Hrithik.It's a truth Hrithik never dated psycho stalker. It was in her head. Lol at kangana dumped himhaha.
Rajeev masand and kangana along with Salman confirmed Katrina fling with Hrithik.
Truth should be postedKatrina never dated hrithik. Even kangana said when she told the story that he was on a foreign shoot when she heard rumors in media. N I called him to ask him about it. N then she said I told him it's valentines day if you want to do something special. It's clear that he cleared her the rumors otherwise she would have attacked him about it. N would have bad mouth Kat. They wanted to create a buzz for the movie n so they started rumors of them dating. If you notice bang bang promotions Kat n hrithik look quite irritated with each other. But they look so hot together that they want to keep the pair working.
Also Salman just mentioned in kwk when KJo asked what will u advise Ranbir. He said have fun. Thrn what will you advise Kat n he said make sure he doesn't have fun. what would u advise hrithik. He said you stay out of it. When KJo asked Matlab. He said just made a knowing face. Cause hr PR was spreading rumors of dating n he advised not to interfere. Please don't speculate wrong.Kat did had a fling with Hrithik. Kangana said it at aap ki adalat. Also there were blinds about them. Salman too confirmed it. Dont deny it. Recently Rajeev masand too said it. And according to kat fans Rajeev blinds are always true and authentic. HR pr didnt spread rumours. Dont deny the truth. Kat is not a saint. Accept the fact.Exactly. At that time hritik was getting attention for kangana and he rather wanted to divert attention to the most desirable women in India Katrina. Also kangana would have given public statement against kat if she was dating her bf. And so does have deepika publicly badmouthed Deepika if rk cheated her with kat. It must be some other women.Hrithik was NEVER kangana BF. Kat had an affair with Hrithik. He doesn't need a flop and other man girl to divert attention that too when he is still desirable man in india. RK did cheated DP for Kat . There are countless articles and proofs. THe big one is kat visting him in USA when he was with DP.Couldn't agree more. Atleast Alia didnt started a relationship with a committed guy neither cheated her boyfriend unlike Katrina who went for Ranbir who was dating another girl while living in with Salman.Pinkvilla when did she win awards for her average performance in zero? She bought zee award though she didnt deserves it. Screen and filmfare awards went to other deserving ladies.Katrina it’s cool to do whatever it is that you are doing in personal life.
If you are sharing cool, keeping it a secret cool or throwing a bone at a lot of dogs to fight over your life even cooler..You are reaping what you sow Katrina.I am a die heart Katrina fan but have no sympathy for her when it comes to Ranbir.Then you are not a fan of hers. You must because die heart hater, better go and die hard.Dont need your approval. I am her fan and not blind to choose her mistake . People like you are her haters because you have no guts to say the truth.Truth is its Katrina's way of dealing to not react to the rumours spread against her. If you believe those rumours and don't like her then why you claim to be a fan.Her biggest achievement in life will be that she is the 7 Indian celebrity to be waxed in Madame Tussauds London. It is the biggest honour for any Bollywood celebrity. Ranbir and his family can only go and take pictures with those global icons. Hahaha....A person who fails to be loyal to man who helped her in her bad days ,expecting others to be loyal to her. What an irony.! She was not loyal to Ranbir either and cheated on him with Hrithik. Kangana and rajeev confirmed it.User Katrina always fell in love with rich and popular guys who have a bright future. She desperately ran after Rk when he was tagged a a next big thing. She was so keen to have his surname that she accepted his cheating and humiliation. Only a cheater like Katrina will accept his cheating ways. Later, she chased Rs when he becomes a hit and spread bff rumours and begging everyone to give her a movie opposite him. Now vickey is a star in making, so madam is flirting with him and broke his relationship as well. Rajeev masand confirmed Katrina cheating Rk and her past. He even said Salman and family has broken ties with her. She is known to break relationships and chasing successful guys. Truth should be posted.Well Said!!Katrina posts hardly have any comments. She took Rk name and see 70 comments in 30 mins. Rk is a big star and immensely popular.Doesn't mean he is a superstar. He is topic of gossip. N people take him that way only. The Kardashians. He has no grace n no self respect.This also implies to Katrina. :pLMAO it's Katrina who is India's most googled woman from past 12 years. Ranbir don't even makes it to top 10.Lamo. She isn't most Google for 12 years. It's also paid by her Pr. Rk doesn't need such things. See what people googled about her ; Salman, ranbir, boom, and her past. HahaTired of seeing these girls like Katrina and Deepika talk about their breakup. I have read 3-4 articles by deepika's pr this month that are almost 10 years old. Her pr is using them again to make her relevant. And then we have Katrina who promoted her last film on behalf of her relationship and again her new film as well. Poor ranbir. And then their is a pshcyo kangana who is annoyed that ranbir didn't give her bhav like ritik.Wow it's great to see that in a time of evolution for women in this country, toxic masculinity is still supported by blinded fans. She has the right to hurt in whichever way she wants to. She's heartbroken too, give her time to move on instead of trolling and lathing her with hate, no one deserves that.Why it only implies on Katrina? Why her fans abuse Deepika when she exposed Ranbir ?, wasnt she heartbroken and hurt? Why Katrina fans trolled and hated her ? Katrina deserves it. She is heartbroken because she broke many hearts and hurt people to get her happiness but no one stay happy by hurting others
Pv postKatrina PR wishing for Alia movie to be a flop and talking about karma has forgot that Katrina movies are flop. Bharat and sorayavanhsi will be a hit because of Salman and akshay while KARMA hit her hard. She is left all alone and single at 40 with no movies and a list of flops while all her rivals are happily married and settled.Haha I am Katrina pr and your mother is a R.....RK tried his hands on Jaquiline, Kangna, and Anushka, did they fall for him? Just bcoz he gave you bhav, you shouldnt have left Salman. RK sab chin leta hai, Salman is a giver.
I dont like Anushka, but have highest respect for her that, she never in her life fell for RK or gave any bhav to him.only person RK ddint try was kangana... she offered..Jackie cudnt go to him because she is Salman’s mistressIn your dreams kanganaOh cmon it was Anushka whowas after him...not vice versaStop lying ranbir have some shame, seriously you don't leave any women, even not leaving kids like alia. You shameless creature Virat is the most manly guy in India, why would his girlfriend think of leaving him for a tranny like you.He also tried on nargis fakhri and imran khan's wifey.Imran Khan wife was his first girlfriend....check your facts firstImran and avantika are a happily married couple. Stop talking about her ranbir.Woman who loved to be a doormat and a chaser dont have a right to complain.Btw what does your mother loves. Chocolates or strawberry. Though I can give her the real taste as well.Contact kat. After all her mother is P and had multiple partners like her daughter.Karma will hit Katrina and deepika for ruining ranbirs name for their selfish agendas.ExactlyDont drag Dp here . She loved him and didnt ruined his life.Dying to get Ranbir.:p katty baby that ship has sail long ago. Have some dignity and leave him alone.Ranbir is dignified and classy enough not to talk about breakup and not defaming kat and family like she did to him. That's is so graceful of him.For how many times she will open about her breakup with Ranbir?She stated Salman bhajan when asked about movies and now ranting Ranbir bhajan when nobody asked her about him. Desperate woman.Bhajan???? Salman ne koi naya bhajan banaya kya?Katrina hasn't move on clearly.I am not aware of the truth but one thing is for sure that Katrina Turquote is not a victim in this case. How the hell she thought that he would be loyal to her? Why didnt she think even for a minute that what she has done to Deepika, someone else will do it to her? Why cheated Salman? You cant be happy by hurting other people.she is going the deepika way but in a gracious way.Don't worry kat, kapoor family will pay their karma.Rishi already did, neetu and ranbir left though.Copy kat copying Deepika? Deepika was fearless and have a spine to speak directly about it and on time . Kapoor tried to isolate her and she suffered .she did in a graceful manner. Katrina has no spine to talk about what he did to her directly and only speaking during a release of her movie and after 4 years. So there is a huge differenceManipulative Kat ,you cheated RK with Hrithik while having a live in realtionship with him. Lied about your dirty past and played games which compel him to dumped you. Dont dare to act like a victim when you are not.Someone said it finallyKatrina tried hard to break Salman ilulia but failed and shamelessly broke Vickey Harleen but she cant go for him as his parents warned him so now wants to break Ranbir Alia.Katrina went to Ranbir on filmfare night and hugged and kissed him. Simply because she wants him back . Now, when he refused to take this cheater back, she is taking revenge by putting blame on him entirely. How sick !Katrina always badmouth and slander Ranbir and his family indirectly (as she is a coward to speak directly)but her fans say, she never badmouth Ranbir and acts gracefully. Haha. Stabbing from the back is what she is known for. Its dangerous.Go and take TOEFL and IELTS classes and then try commenting again with some logicGo and learn some manners which your parents failed to teach you
Posting cheap comments and abusing mothers.But my father taught me to insert banana in your mother's v......Does Katrina has any shame? It's totally her fault . Now crying to get sympathy.When you dont have anything to talk about your extended cameo in a big hero movie, defame your Ex, acts like a sati savatri and fool people by lying to them. #fake kat #userkatShe used Rk to promote her flop zero and now playing the same game to promote her Bharat.Katrina , is on a spree to defame Ranbir. She ruined his career and image. Shame on you Katrina.Katrina shut up.Only fools will sympathize with kat.I sympathize with her and I’m not a fool!Ok Katrina.USER KATRINA is the most fake, most manipulative, most cunning and a PR queen .Since sallu is ignoring her and not giving her any importance, this manipulative woman trying to get attention by using Rk name.1) she’s not manipulative
2) Sallu is not ignoring her since he just finished Bharat with her
3) taking RK name won’t give her attention because RK is a scum
4) you are an idiot!1) she is manipulative. 2) Sallu ignoring her . Finishing a movie is a job 3) taking rk name do give her attention because she is a loser 4) you are blind.
Post itSalman Salman Ranbir ranbir. That what talentless Katrina can do.Why despo is talking about it after 4 years? Oh her movie is coming.Badmouthing her Ex and portraying him as a villain to get sympathy. Katrina aunty is so cunning.Ranbir kapoor chill and calm downGosh! This disprina is sick. Stop acting like a saint. Its you who chased him and stuck to him though he asked you to leave. You cheated your mentor and hurt Dp . Katrina you deserves it.Kat is NOT over Ranbir.Desperate Katrina, again using Rk name to promote her movie.They really used to love each other... SMH!Kat using her personal life to stay in news.Disgusting botox buddhiHi Katrina you are a fabulous actor and one of the best actress.And one thing more that just focus on your career and ranbir kapoor is a bull shit person he is not at all capable to you.so just concentrate on your career.Hi kat, you are not a fabulous actor. Infact a worst actor and a person. Your career is over and you are a shit person who doesnt deserves Rk.
Pv be fair to postEveryone is after whos successful and trendy..nobody talks about unsuccessful...Alia does not utter a word about Siddarth Malhotra here she was chanting, worshipping publicly Ranbir Kapoor within a months if dating ...Deepika dated Nihar pandya,bankrupt Siddarth malya but she didn't utter a word about them..but she has a lot to talk about short lived fling with Ranbir Kapoor even after 8 years..she didn't accept Ranveer Singh till he became famous...he only said she kept relationship open back in 2013 matalab she can date any other while dating him...atleast Katrina's was long, live in..even if talks in the beginning its fine we can understand but it's been 4 years..earlier she never talked about relationship with Salman but she is still referring th at relationship with rabbit is not making her no different from Alia and Deepika...these ladies thinks dating and becoming ex with Ranbir kapoor is trendy something great..what the heck is this?thisnguy Ranbir does not need extra PR his ex , ex ex , his current were doing PR, are doing, will do PR...Kya naseeb hai yar Ranbir kaYou seriously need English classes. Consider going to coaching classes for TOEFL and next time please spare us your horrendous grammar. PV please at least screen the comments properly before posting!Why bringing Dp here ? She didnt bankrupt malays. She loved and accepted Rs much before he becomes successful that too when she was more successful than Rs. Katrina didnt talk about her fling with Hrithik, John and Akshay. Never talked how she broke rkdp. She bankrupt Salman. But still talking about her short fling and on and off relationship with Ranbir. Even after 5 years. Despo still talking about Salman after 10 years despite cheating him.
Be fair to Dp and postOh you poor girlOh you poor girlOh you poor girlIf any journalists asks about him please say I don't talk about it or date someone what f*** is this?kya strong strong kitna bar bologi?seriously you will lose your credibility nobody will take you seriously if you keep on talking about past...Here alia talks like wtf heart shining..Deepika will when she starts promoting chappak...these ladies seriously don't they have self respect show him his place don't talk like you give him importance...what kind of women empowerment is happening here..1 man is controlling 3 WomenHer boyfriend and best friend broke her.This is worst one can imagine.Hope brahmastra be the biggest flop in history, and karma is served.Nobody broke her. She pretended to be a bestie with Alia for her motives. She broke many relationships. Please don't show her as a victim. The worst is what she did to Deeoika,Salman, Harleen and many others Dont wish bad for others. KARMA hit Katrina with full force. Hope all movies of her flops like they are from past 7 years.
Pv postAll these girls are mad about Ranbir because of his looks, status..but seriously he as a person big gossipy queen I would never want to date a guy who gossips in real life that's so girly even girls like Anushka don't do that...Katrina instead of giving this boring lecture just say past is past I don't talk about it...what is this you , deepika, alia all you are increasing girly, gossipy , cheater Ranbir's value highNobody has the guess to call out Ranbir..so he thinks whatever he does is right...If Kangana was ex insted of Katrina...Kangan Ranbir itna band bajadeti ki Ranbir will not dare to cheat any other girlsSo what Alia has also slept with multiple guys, she herself said it main thodi Ho na kaam hoon. ??STFU stop using his name in ur every flop movie promotion u dp now alu just behind his Kapoor tag n his money. Alu will end relationship like u or more worst than u.So graceful! Shows a true class.So desperate. Shows kat is a user.
Class complex fanFalling in love with a wrong person makes a woman realise her true worth.
Well, now with Alia Bhatt Ranbir Kapoor looks hypnotised and sick. The problem is in the boy.One who can leave a graceful lady like Katrina he can never live happily in his whole life. He will see world falling apart infront of him very soon.What about being person Katrina? She is anything but graceful. She us not a loyal person and everyone knows that. Problem moves with Katrina. She left a loyal person like Salman so she can never live happily in her whole life. Karma hit her hard. Dont blame Rk alone.I don't know why girls act so pure after a man breaks up with them and they're already sleeping around. Katrina had vicky rumours, deepika basically did anyone who was rich and available and yet blamed ranbir like he was the only man they put out for. You moved on slept with someone else now don't give me the sati savitri garbage and carry on with your life.Katrina , it’s not about you. It’s insecure Neetu Singh and spinessless character RK. But you should have known important of Salman that he gives life and platform to succeed to his girl friend but RK uses girls friend platform to succeed and be in news and leave them when they are low. Don’t worry RK aur Neetu ke din ayenge. Karma bites the worst when u expect the leastIts about kat who is shameless and a despo. She desperately wanted Kapoor tag . KARMA hit insecure and realtionship breaker Katrina.Katrina , it’s not about you. It’s insecure Neetu Singh and spinessless character RK. But you should have known important of Salman that he gives life and platform to succeed to his girl friend but RK uses girls friend platform to succeed and be in news and leave them when they are low. Don’t worry RK aur Neetu ke din ayenge. Karma bites the worst when u expect the leastall the best to you Kat! I watched the Bharat trailer just for your kick-ass dialogue. MwahAbe ja apni mummy k pass ja ke ro. Acting like a sati savitri has never slept with any other man than ranbir. Oh iam so pure. Ranbir break my heart. Bloody hypocrite.Yes katrina, u r absolutely rightBe glad you're out of that relationship as he is a real douche bag.. I'm sure there are far better things on the horizon..Before calling Ranbir a douchebag look at your cheater and desperate Katrina.Similar statements from all the A-list girls in the industry during the past decade coz of one and only RK!Poor girl !

Jahan forcefully entered the house with her daughter and reportedly told the police that she would stay there as it was her and Shami's house.,CricTracker,"Mohammed Shami‘s wife Hasin Jahan has been in the news since last year when she accused the Indian cricketer of beating her and having extra-marital affairs. The incident affected Shami’s cricketing career at that point in time but he moved on to become India’s one of the lead pacers. He has been picked in the team for World Cup and will most probably be in the playing XI as well. But Hasin Jahan is yet to move on it seems.Late night on Sunday, she barged into Shami’s house and was involved in an argument with the cricketer’s mother according to Times Now. It is learnt that Hasin Jahan first entered into the house with her daughter Bebo and started arguing with her in-laws. Shami’s parents then called the police and claimed that Hasin entered into the house forcefully.AdvertisementAs per the reports, the police have arrested her under section 151 which says that the police can arrest a person without a warrant for 24 hours. Hasin Jahan, meanwhile, has claimed that the police arrested due to Mohammed Shami’s fame and denied the allegations.Mohammed Shami, however, has recovered well from his family issues to emerge as one of the top cricketers in the country. He performed exceptionally well on Australia and New Zealand tours and sealed the third pacer’s slot in the Indian team for the World Cup.The fast bowler has been doing extremely well for Kings XI Punjab (KXIP) in the ongoing Indian Premier League (IPL) and has played all 11 matches for them.

19981,Retired HC judge booked for assaulting daughter-in-law for dowry,"A retired judge, who served at the Hyderabad and Madras High Courts, along with his wife and son were booked in Hyderabad for allegedly harassing the daughter-in-law for dowry and assaulting her last week. The complainant, a 30-year-old woman, was reportedly admitted to hospital after being assaulted. The three accused are expected to be summoned by police for questioning.",The News Minute,"(Update: TNM spoke to the daughter-in-law after the videos of domestic violence surfaced. Read the story here: ‘All 3 of them attacked me’: Daughter-in-law of retd HC judge on domestic violence video)A retired judge, who served at the Hyderabad and Madras High Courts, was booked by the police in Hyderabad for allegedly harassing his daughter-in-law for dowry and assaulting her last week.The complainant, 30-year-old Sindhu Sharma, had approached the Central Crime Station in the city and alleged that Justice Nooty Ramamohana Rao, his wife, Nooty Durga Jaya Laxmi and their son, Nooty Vasista, had repeatedly harassed her, allegedly over dowry, and also physically assaulted her.Ramamohana Rao was a senior judge, who was transferred from the Hyderabad High Court in 2016 and had retired in August 2017 while serving at the Madras HC. He had also served at the Madurai bench of the HC for a brief period.Speaking to TNM, Srinivas Madagula, the complainant's uncle, alleged, ""The wedding took place in 2012. They were continuously harassing her and demanding dowry from then itself. Over the last two years or so, it escalated with the family beating her mercilessly, and putting her through mental torture.""On April 20, the family allegedly thrashed Sindhu to such an extent that she had to be rushed to a hospital.""They took her to Apollo hospital in Jubilee Hills and seeing her injuries, the doctors insisted on a medico-legal case (MLC),"" Srinivas said.A copy of the MLC, which is with TNM, shows doctors stating that there were nail abrasions over the chest, suggesting that someone had scratched her, besides abrasions in other parts of her body. The doctors also noted that there were bruises over the right shoulder and right forearm.""After she was admitted to the hospital, she regained proper consciousness and called her parents and me around midnight, saying that she had been beaten up. After 1 am, a Sub Inspector from the Jubilee Hills police station visited the hospital and took down her statement, but she could not recollect events properly as she was under mental duress,"" her uncle said.She was later discharged and taken to her parents’ house at Uppal by her family, where she is currently recovering.""They have also snatched her two children; one is a three-year-old girl while the other is a one-and-a-half-year-old infant,"" Srinivas alleged.The woman's family also alleged that complaints were filed in the past and repeated attempts at counselling by the police also did not yield any results. The two families also attempted to work out an amicable solution, but in vain, following which the woman's family decided to opt for legal recourse.Meanwhile, a case has been registered under IPC sections 498A (Husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty), 406 (Criminal breach of trust) and 323 (Voluntarily causing hurt) and Section 6 of the Dowry Prevention Act against the three accused.While no arrests were made, the three accused are expected to be summoned by the police for questioning.TNM reached out to the retired judge’s family but they refused to offer a comment, claiming it was a ‘private matter.’(Update: TNM spoke to the daughter-in-law after the videos of domestic violence surfaced.

19985,Sri Lanka bans face coverings after serial blasts that killed 250,"Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena has said he is using emergency powers to ban any form of face covering in public over the serial bomb blasts that killed over 250 people. ""The ban is to ensure national security. No one should obscure their faces to make identification difficult,"" he added. The restriction will take effect from Monday.",The Quint,"The effects of Sri Lanka's Easter suicide bombings reverberated across two faiths on Sunday, 28 April, with Catholics shut out of their churches for fear of new attacks, having no other go but to attend only televised mass, and Muslim women ordered against wearing veils in public.Many across the nation knelt before their televisions as Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith, the archbishop of Colombo, delivered a homily before members of the clergy and the country's leaders in a small chapel at his residence in the capital.The closing of all of Sri Lanka's Catholic churches – an extraordinary measure unheard of in the church's centuries on this island off the southern tip of India – came after local officials and the US Embassy in Colombo warned that more militants remained on the loose with explosives a week after bombings claimed by the Islamic State group and aimed at churches and hotels killed more than 250 people.Also Read : Sri Lanka Bans Face Coverings After Easter Bomb AttacksBefore services began, the Islamic State group claimed three militants who blew themselves up on Friday night after exchanging fire with police in the country's east. Investigators sifting through that site and others uncovered a bomb-making operation capable of spreading far more destruction.""This is a time our hearts are tested by the great destruction that took place last Sunday,"" Ranjith told those watching across the nation. ""This is a time questions such as, does God truly love us, does he have compassion toward us, can arise in human hearts.""Also Read : After Serial Blasts, Sri Lanka Suspends Visa on Arrival ProgrammeLater on Sunday, President Maithripala Sirisena banned all kinds of face coverings that may conceal people's identities. The emergency law, which takes effect Monday, prevents Muslim women from veiling their faces.The decision came after the cabinet had proposed laws on face veils at a recent meeting. It had deferred the matter until talks with Islamic clerics could be held, on the advice of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.Police said they had arrested 48 suspects over the last 24 hours as checkpoints mounted by all of Sri Lanka's security forces sprung up across this country of 21 million people. Those arrested include two men whom authorities recently appealed to the public to locate.The government also warned that it would crack down on those spreading false information and making inflammatory remarks.Also Read : 3-5 Yr Jail Term For Spreading Fake News About  Sri Lankan BlastsPolice, meanwhile, entered the main mosque of National Towheed Jamaat on Sunday afternoon, just a day after authorities declared it and another organization terror groups over the bombings.Police entered the mosque, located in Kattankudy in eastern Sri Lanka, and stopped an interview among foreign journalists and mosque officials. Later, a senior police officer dispersed journalists waiting outside, saying authorities were conducting a ""cordon and search operation.""Police then left, locking up the mosque just before afternoon prayers were to start.Authorities banned National Towheed Jamaat over its ties to Mohammed Zahran, the alleged mastermind of the Easter Sunday bombings. Zahran and masked others had pledged their loyalty to IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi before carrying out the attacks, showing the danger the extremist group poses even after losing all its territory in Iraq and Syria.On Friday night, a confrontation with police sparked a firefight with the militants in Kalmunai, some 225 kilometers (140 miles) northeast of Colombo. Sri Lanka's military said the gunfire and later suicide blasts killed 15 people, including six children.Also Read : Indians Asked Not to Undertake Non-essential Travel to Sri LankaPolice spokesman Ruwan Gunasekara said a woman and a 4-year-old child found wounded after the gunbattle have been identified as Zahran's wife and daughter.At the main police station in Ampara, an outdoor stage now holds what police recovered after the firefight. The IS-aligned militants had created a bomb-making factory at the home, complete with laboratory-style beakers and thick rubber gloves.Bags of fertilizer, gunpowder and small ball bearings filled boxes. Police found tens of liters (gallons) of acids, used to make the fire of the blast more lethal.A police investigator, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because he wasn't authorized to publicly comment, said the mix of acids worsened the wounds suffered by those who didn't immediately die in the blast.""At the hospital a lot more people died. That's why,"" he said, nodding toward the acids. ""It made the wounds incurable.""Along with the acids, the bombs contained a mixture of fertilizer, gunpowder, ball bearings and explosives typically used by quarries to blast loose rocks, the investigator said. Those explosives made the bombs powerful enough to blow the roof off of St. Sebastian's Church in Negombo, he said, referring to one of the churches near Colombo targeted in the Easter attacks.The Sri Lankan navy controls the sale of the mining explosives and investigators already have begun tracing the serial numbers off of the plastic sticks, he said. A notebook contained bomb-making instructions that had apparently been explained to the writer.Police also recovered religious tracts in Tamil glorifying suicide bombings, saying they granted the attacker direct entrance to heaven. The investigator contrasted that to the Tamil Tigers, a separatist group the government defeated in 2009 after a 26-year civil war.""Their only intention is to kill as many as possible,"" the investigator said. ""That is different than the Tamil Tigers. They wanted to control land. These people want to kill as many as possible.""(Hi there!

Helo app supports 14 Indian languages.",YourStory,"Social media platform Helo, which focusses on Indian language users, said it has removed about 1.6 lakh accounts and five million posts from its platform over the last 10 months after they were found to be violating its guidelines.The platform, which is operated by China's ByteDance that also runs TikTok, started its services in India in June last year.""We started Helo last year in June with the aim of providing users of Indian languages a platform to connect and communicate in a safe environment. It is an India-focussed app and we have seen a strong adoption not only in the country but also among the Indian diaspora in the US, Malaysia, Nepal and other countries,"" Shyamanga Barooah, Head of content operations, Helo told PTI.He added that the platform currently has about 40 million users and supports 14 Indian languages.""User safety is a prime focus for us. In the last 10 months, we have taken down 1.6 lakh accounts and about five million posts that were found to be violating our community guidelines,"" he said.Asked if the removed content was political in nature, Barooah said ""political-centric fake content was 0.07 percent of the total content that was removed, it was very miniscule"".He said users are sharing content across the spectrum like hyperlocal news and couplets, while celebrities and influencers are using the platform to connect to their audience in various Indian languages like Telugu, Kannada, and Gujarati among others.According to a report by Google, the number of Internet users in Indian languages is expected to reach 536 million over the next three years, contributing 35 percent of $4.4 billion digital ad spend in the country.

19991,"Gaming phone with cooling fan, 8K video recording unveiled","Chinese smartphone company Nubia Technology has unveiled its new gaming smartphone dubbed 'Nubia Red Magic 3' that has a built-in cooling fan and can record videos in 8K. Equipped with a 48MP rear camera and 16MP front camera, the phone has slow-motion recording capability at 1,920 fps. Further, the phone has a 6.65-inch AMOLED screen.",Engadget,"We've already seen the likes of ASUS and Black Shark offering external cooling fans for their gaming smartphones, but the folks over at Nubia reckon it's about time to stuff a fan inside a phone (I mean, what else would you expect from a company that brought back the wearable phone?). Today, the Chinese brand unveiled the Red Magic 3 which not only packs a ""liquid cooling"" copper heat pipe, but also an internal cooling fan.This small fan is said to run quietly but can spin up to 14,000 rpm, and it has an IP55 rating plus its own isolated chamber, so you won't have to worry about liquids and dust getting in. It's apparently good for over 30,000 hours of continuous use, though Nubia didn't specify the speed used for the test. Regardless, combining this fan with the heat pipe, the phone's heat transfer performance is apparently five times better than conventional passive cooling methods, thus ensuring a smooth gaming experience for a longer period.Much like its predecessors and some direct competitors, the Red Magic 3 comes with customizable capacitive shoulder triggers and an RGB LED strip on the back to keep competitive gamers happy. As a bonus, the fingerprint reader above the RGB strip can also be mapped as a button for gaming. The phone has also inherited the hardware switch for toggling the ""Red Magic Game Space 2.0"" dashboard, where you can access your game library and related settings -- including fan speeds, screen recording and notifications.The rest of this Android 9 phone is pretty much a bog-standard flagship with a few bonuses. You get the usual Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 chipset with up to 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, plus there's a generous 5,000mAh battery with USB Power Delivery quick charge of up to 27W (compatible with QC 4.0).As for cameras, the Red Magic 3 comes with a 48-megapixel f/1.7 main imager powered by a Sony IMX586 sensor, along with a 16-megapixel f/2.0 front camera but with an unknown sensor. Sadly, there's no optical stabilization here, but the main camera is setting two new records in the mobile industry: it can apparently handle 8K -- yes, 8K -- video recording, and it also has a super slow motion mode of up to a whopping 1,920 fps (resolution not yet specified). But of course, at the end of the day it's all about the picture quality, so we shall see how these video modes fare when we get hold of our own test device.Things get a little more interesting on the visual and audio side: the 6.65-inch FHD+ AMOLED display handles HDR and packs a 90Hz refresh rate -- the latter will be supported by titles like Vainglory, Forsaken World, Heroes of the Multiverse, Peak Tank and more. The front-facing stereo speakers work with DTS:X surround sound, and the triple-mic noise cancellation comes in handy for those who like to stream their gameplay. Speaking of, there's still a 3.5mm headphone jack here.So how much does the world's first fan-cooled gaming smartphone cost? When it launches in China on May 3rd, it'll start from 2,899 yuan or about $430 (6GB RAM and 64GB storage) and max out at 4,299 yuan or about $640 (12GB RAM and 256GB storage). It's also set to launch in the US, Canada, UK and Europe in late May, but there's no local pricing info just yet. The China launch today also mentioned a couple of accessories that make use of the phone's pogo pins: the 5G radio add-on (a bit like Motorola's 5G Moto Mod; no price yet) and the LAN connection dock (199 yuan or about $30). We'll be keeping an eye out for these for the Western launch.",https://www.engadget.com/2019/04/28/nubia-red-magic-3-gaming-phone-cooling-fan-8k-video/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

19996,Pilots demand better training to rebuild trust in 737 MAX,"Pilots of American Airlines, one of the biggest operators of Boeing 737 MAX, have demanded simulator training rather than a computer-based explanation for the aircraft. Computer training ""won't provide confidence for pilots to feel...comfortable flying the aircraft [and relay] that confidence to the [flyers],"" they said. 737 MAX is currently preparing for regulatory approval of a software update.",Reuters,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - American Airlines pilots have warned that Boeing Co’s  draft training proposals for the troubled 737 MAX do not go far enough to address their concerns, according to written comments submitted to the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration and seen by Reuters.  The comments were made by the Allied Pilots Association (APA), which represents pilots at American Airlines Group Inc, the world’s largest airline and one of the biggest 737 MAX operators in the United States. Their support is important because Boeing has said pilots’ confidence in the 737 MAX will play a critical role in convincing the public that the aircraft is safe to fly again. Boeing’s fast-selling 737 MAX was grounded worldwide in March following a fatal Ethiopian Airlines crash that killed all 157 on board just five months after a similar crash on a Lion Air flight that killed all 189 passengers and crew. Now it is readying for regulatory approval a final software update and training package to address an anti-stall system known as MCAS that played a role in both nose-down crashes.  A draft report by an FAA-appointed board of pilots, engineers and other experts concluded that pilots only need additional computer-based training to understand MCAS, rather than simulator time. The public has until April 30 to make comments.  Protesters are expected outside Boeing’s annual meeting in Chicago on Monday, where shareholders will also question the company over its safety record.   APA is arguing that mere computer explanation “will not provide a level of confidence for pilots to feel not only comfortable flying the aircraft but also relaying that confidence to the traveling public.” It said the MAX computer training, which originally involved a one-hour iPad course, should include videos of simulator sessions showing how MCAS works along with demonstrations of other cockpit emergencies such as runaway stabilizer, a loss of control that occurred on both doomed flights. APA also called for recurring training on simulators that includes scenarios like those experienced by the Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines pilots, in addition to computer training. “When pilots visually experience the failure modes and then apply them, the lesson is cemented in their minds,” APA wrote. American Airlines has said it is looking at the potential for additional training opportunities in coordination with the FAA and its pilots union. Canada, Europe and South Korea are all weighing the need for simulator training, going above the recommendations in the draft FAA report, sources have said. Required simulator training could delay the MAX’s return to service because it takes time to schedule hundreds or thousands of pilots on simulators. Hourly rates for simulators range between $500 and $1000, excluding travel expenses. American Airlines Chief Executive Doug Parker said on Friday that even if other countries delay the ungrounding of the MAX, once the FAA approves it, American will start flying its 24 aircraft.   Union pilots for Southwest Airlines Co, the world’s largest operator of the MAX with 34 jets and dozens more on order, have said they were satisfied with the FAA draft report but would decide on additional training once they see Boeing’s final proposals.

Her friend claimed the theatre doors opened just three minutes before the film's timing, leading to a rush.",The News Minute,"A 32-year-old Bengaluru woman was injured above her lip and had to get stitches after she fell down while entering a movie hall on Saturday night to watch Avengers: Endgame. The incident occurred during the opening of Saturday night’s 10 pm show at Cinepolis Forum Shantiniketan in Whitefield.According to the woman’s friend, Khizer Ahmed Sheriff, who was with her when she fell down, the theatre doors opened just three minutes before the film started. The movie was running full house, and therefore a lot of people rushed in at the same time, leading to the incident, he said.“The show was at 10 o'clock but they opened the doors at 9.57 pm. The entire hall was dark except for the light near the stairs. Since the people in the queue noticed that the movie had started, they rushed to their seats. In that chaos, my friend was pushed and she fell face flat on the stairs. It cut her lip and she hurt her tooth,” Khizer said.Khizer further alleged that the management at Cinepolis was unhelpful. He returned to the theatre after getting medical help for his friend from Manipal Hospital to raise the issue with the staff.“Initially they were very unresponsive, but then they claimed they started the movie on time. Since they did not acknowledge their mistake, a bunch of us (customers) wrote a letter and made the manager sign an acknowledgement with the names of the complainants along with their ticket numbers,” Khizer said.While Khizer and his friends want the theatre to compensate for her medical expenses, so far he says that he has been offered 15 ticket vouchers after multiple phone calls and even a meeting at his friend’s residence.The theatre management meanwhile blamed the rush for he incident, and denied that they had not helped the woman who was injured.Yasir Sohail, the manager present on Saturday night, said, “It was a 10 o’clock show and it was Avengers and we were running housefull shows. 246 – that is the capacity of our theatre – and all of a sudden 246 customers started entering the auditorium. Although the dimmers light and the stairs light was on, she fell down because of the pressure of the crowd. After that we gave her first aid and took her to the hospital and today we went to her home to check up on how she is doing now.”He denied any wrongdoing in terms of time management stating, “We followed the Theatre Management System (an automated system) but there was a huge rush which caused the inconvenience,” he said.   ",https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/woman-injured-avengers-endgame-screening-b-luru-theatre-due-rush-100854?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

However, the Portuguese responded with a powerful finish in the second half to hit 20 league goals for the season, moving within two strikes of Serie A’s leading scorer, Fabio Quagliarella of Sampdoria, in the process. “I have Cristiano Ronaldo and I’m happy,” Juventus coach Massimiliano Allegri told DAZN. “Having a player like him is important, as after making a mistake he was very angry and went on to play a different match.” Inter remain in third place on 62 points, four ahead of AS Roma below them, while Juventus, who dropped points for just the sixth time in 34 games this season, move up to 88. “In the first half we suffered on dead ball situations, we could’ve gone 2-0 behind, but then we had a great second half,” Allegri said.  “Inter is a strong team, fighting for the Champions League. It wasn’t easy, we were down to the bare bones. We’ve got to compliment the lads, as we ended on a high.” This fixture, known as the ‘Derby d’Italia’, is one of the country’s fiercest rivalries. The home fans taunted the visitors with a pre-match mosaic of placards featuring the Champions League trophy alongside the words ‘Game Over’, referencing Juve’s quarter-final exit to Ajax Amsterdam in April. The home support were left delighted just seven minutes in when Nainggolan latched onto Matteo Politano’s dipping pass and unleashed a swerving volley from 25 yards out that flew past Juve goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny into the corner. Ronaldo drew Juventus level after 62 minutes, exchanging passes with Miralem Pjanic before drilling a left-footed finish into the bottom corner. It was the 600th goal of the 34-year-old’s club career, with 450 having come at Real Madrid, 118 at Manchester United, 27 at Juventus and five at Sporting Lisbon. The Portugal international is narrowly ahead of Lionel Messi, who scored his 598th goal for Barcelona to help them win the Spanish La Liga title with a 1-0 win over Levante on Saturday.

20018,"Walmart concept store in NY has AI cams, interactive walls","Walmart has unveiled its 50,000 square-foot AI-powered concept store, the 'Intelligent Retail Lab' in New York, which features AI-enabled cameras and interactive walls. The store's cameras and real-time analytics monitor inventory levels and automatically trigger alerts to internal apps to remind employees to restock products. Walmart claims the cameras and sensors pump out 1.6TB of data a second.",TechCrunch,"Walmart  this morning unveiled a new “store of the future” and test grounds for emerging technologies, including AI-enabled cameras and interactive displays. The store, a working concept called the Intelligent Retail Lab — or “IRL” for short — operates out of a Walmart Neighborhood Market in Levittown, N.Y.The store is open to customers and is one of Walmart’s busiest Neighborhood Market stores, containing more than 30,000 items, the retailer says, which allows it to test out technology in a real-world environment.Similar to Amazon Go’s convenience stores, the store has a suite of cameras mounted in the ceiling. But unlike Amazon Go, which is a grab-and-go store with smaller square footage, Walmart’s IRL spans 50,000 square feet of retail space and is staffed by more than 100 employees.Plus, in Walmart’s case, these AI-powered cameras are not being used to determine which items customers are buying in order to automatically charge them. It still has traditional checkout stations. Instead, the cameras will monitor inventory levels to determine, for example, if staff needs to bring out more meat from the back-room refrigerators to restock the shelves, or if some fresh items have been sitting too long on the shelf and need to be pulled.The idea is that the AI will help the store associates know more precisely where and when to restock products. And this, in turn, means customers will know the produce and meat is always fresh and in stock when they arrive.Using technology to do this is not simple, Walmart says. It means the automated system will need to be able to detect products on the shelf, recognize the exact product it sees (1 lb of ground beef versus 2 lbs., etc.), and then compare the quantities on the shelf to upcoming sales demand.For store associates, the system allows them to stop constantly walking the store to replace inventory — instead, they’ll know what to bring out from the back room before the doors even open to customers that day.The cameras and other sensors in the store pump out 1.6 TB of data per second, or the equivalent of three years’ worth of music, which necessitates a big data center on site. At the IRL store, it’s glass-encased, bathed in blue light and on display to the public.This could seem a little intimidating — AI cameras and giant servers. But Walmart says the data is only stored for less than a week.There are also informational stations in the store where customers can learn more about the technology in use. A Welcome Center in the store is available too, for customers who want to learn more about the technical specifications and get answers to common questions.An interactive wall lets customers have fun with AI — it demonstrates how an AI system can estimate body positioning. But really it’s meant to make all this new technology seem less intimidating.“Technology enables us to understand so much more – in real time – about our business,” says Mike Hanrahan, CEO of IRL. “When you combine all the information we’re gathering in IRL with Walmart’s 50-plus years of expertise in running stores, you can create really powerful experiences that improve the lives of both our customers and associates.”There’s an interest at Walmart for using AI for more practical purposes in retail  — and the CEO makes what is perhaps a veiled reference to Amazon Go, in a statement.“You can’t be overly enamored with the shiny object element of AI,” Hanrahan said. “There are a lot of shiny objects out there that are doing things we think are unrealistic to scale and probably, long-term, not beneficial for the consumer.”Instead of focusing on automated checkout solutions, the future concepts Walmart will test at IRL after meat inventory levels are using the AI system to ensure that there are shopping carts available at all times and that registers are open and staffed.The company insists that the tech isn’t replacing jobs, but instead frees up staff to interact with customers. That’s the same claim it made as it rolled out more robots to its stores. But it’s hard to see how, over time, more efficiently run stores would require as many associates as they do now.IRL is a concept designed by Walmart’s tech incubator Store No 8, which runs several ventures to test new ideas in retail. Earlier this year, it launched a startup that offers VR tours to enhance the shopping experience, and in 2017 it began testing a personal shopping service called Code Eight in NYC.",https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/25/walmart-unveils-an-a-i-powered-store-of-the-future-now-open-to-the-public/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

20022,GDP growth may top 7% in FY20: CEA Krishnamurthy Subramanian,"Chief Economic Advisor (CEA) Krishnamurthy Subramanian has said India's GDP is likely to be over 7% in 2019-20. He attributed the slowdown over last two quarters of FY19 to structural factors as well as ""something that's a hangover of what has happened earlier."" The CEA added the government would stick to fiscal deficit target of 3.4% of GDP for 2019-20.",The Financial Express,"Though the general elections have slowed down economic activity as the industry awaits a new government to take shape at the Centre, the economic growth is likely to be more than 7% in 2019-20, chief economic advisor Krishnamurthy Subramanian said on Friday. He attributed the slowdown over the last two quarters to structural factors as well as “something that is a hangover of what has happened earlier”.“This is an election season, and historically, we have always seen there is some uncertainty around the election developments and therefore, there is a wait and watch mode that corporate and other agents in the economy adopt….this would be something that we hope would go away once the election process is over,” Subramanian said.Speaking to CNBC TV18, Subramanian said the Centre would stick to the 3.4% (of GDP) fiscal deficit target for 2018-19 (for which data will be released next month) and 2019-20.Also read: India may be on US ‘Priority Watch List’, but no need to revisit IPR; former commerce secretary tells whyOn difficulties being faced by more non-banking finance companies (NBFCs), he said the government is aware of the matter and would initiate steps at the right time. Besides the automobile sector, the slowdown faced by fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) players have also created some concerns in the market.Capacity utilisation has still not reached an average of about 75%. “So, the demand for investments from corporate is still to pick up and we also had corporates and the banks leveraged significantly, which they are trying to wind down,” Subramanian said. So, this is a process because of which the capital formation in the economy had come down and effects of which “we are now seeing”, he said.With manufacturing, agriculture and small services faltering and government spending slowing, the GDP grew at a five-quarter-low rate of 6.6% in the September-December period (Q3) of 2018-19. The Central Statistics Office (CSO) has revised downward the 2018-19 growth projection to 7% — a five-year trough — from 7.2% in the first advance estimate released in January.With the fall in growth rates, given a loss of momentum since Q2, including in the high-frequency data available for post-Q3 period, economists predicted the growth to be more anaemic in Q4 at 6.1-6.4%, with a recovery to be expected in Q1FY20 or thereafter.On tax collection targets, Subramanian said the government would put emphasis on indirect tax collections and some other steps that are being planned. “Those would help in bringing back buoyancy, increasing the buoyancy on indirect tax collections,” he said.On concerns with regard to NBFCs, the CEA said, “The NBFC situation is better than what it was at the time when the IL&FS crisis had happened; it has been contained.” He said the government was aware of rating downgrade of some NBFCs and was seized of this matter. “There are some NBFCs which are facing some difficulties, which is something we are monitoring very carefully and we will take steps as and when required,” he said.Do you know What is  Fiscal Policy in India, Expenditure Budget, Customs Duty, Reverse Repo Rate, Receipt Budget?

20025,2007 Cricket World Cup final 'ended twice',"Australia began celebrating their 2007 CWC final victory after Sri Lanka accepted the offer of bad light following the 33rd over. The on-field umpire told Ricky Ponting the match wasn't over and Australia would've to bowl the remaining overs on the reserve day. However, both captains reached a consensus and the remaining three overs were bowled on the same day.",Cricket Country,"World Cup 2007 ended on April 28, 2007 under dark sky and after a few farcical overs — which, to be honest, was a fitting end to perhaps the most disastrous edition of the biggest cricket tournament on Earth. Abhishek Mukherjee looks back at the near-nonsensical events that overshadowed a once-in-a-generation performance by Adam Gilchrist.Coloured clothing for cricketers and umpires, coloured gear, white balls, late hours, black sight-screens: day-and-night had revolutionised cricket, especially the shorter formats, in more ways than one. The most salient feature of cricket under lights, however, is the fact that it is played under lights; hence the name.The simple requirement was flouted that day at Kensington Oval, that too in a World Cup final. The match went on under farcical conditions, and by the time Australia lifted their third consecutive World Cup, the waxing gibbous in the sky was the only source of light in a ground that was certainly not meant for cricket after the Sun went down.There was little doubt that the best two teams of the tournament had met in the final. Though Australia were head and shoulders above the other sides, Sri Lanka were definitely the next best; South Africa, perhaps the only side that could match Sri Lanka, went down in the semifinal when an all-out aggressive strategy against Australia backfired completely.ALSO READThough the teams played well (despite the anticlimactic exit of India and Pakistan in the league stage), the organisers acted unprofessionally throughout the tournament. Overpriced tickets led to empty stands, and the players kept on performing hard in silence — an unthinkable atmosphere in West Indies. “They have brought the World Cup to the most joyous and spontaneous part of the cricket world and squeezed every ounce of enjoyment out of it,” wrote Sambit Bal in ESPNCricinfo.There were doubts over the final being played at all on the stipulated day following a steady drizzle that converted into a heavy shower. Steve Bucknor and Aleem Dar went out several times before declaring that it will be a 38-over contest, and would start at 12.15 PM. Ricky Ponting had no hesitation in batting first, and out came Matthew Hayden and Adam Gilchrist.Put to the swordChaminda Vaas and Lasith Malinga had two quiet overs that resulted in four runs. Then all hell broke loose: the second ball of the third over was casually flicked for four, and the next ball soared into the stands over long-on. Vaas’ next over saw two more boundaries from Gilchrist, and though he threatened to cut loose, Sri Lanka did a fantastic job to keep Australia to 46 from 10 overs. Vaas had changed ends meanwhile, Dilhara Fernando had been introduced, and given that it was a 38-over match, the advantage lay with Sri Lanka.Then came the drop: Gilchrist hit a full-blooded shot back to Dilhara; it was low, and Dilhara, certainly not the most acrobatic of fielders, could not hold on to it. At that stage he was on 31 from 31 balls; the next ball raced to the fence past mid-wicket; the one after that, past long-on. Dilhara bowled a short one outside off; Gilchrist thwacked it, off the front foot, cross-batted, over long-on into the stands.Mahela Jayawardene changed his game-plan immediately, introducing both Muttiah Muralitharan and Tillakaratne Dilshan. Murali had a loud appeal in his first over, but Bucknor decided — rightly — that it had pitched outside leg. Gilchrist’s fifty came up with a single as the ball took the leading edge off Murali and went past a diving mid-off. It had taken him 43 balls, and Australia’s score read 69 without loss in 13.1 overs: advantage Sri Lanka, till then.Dilshan’s bowling fell apart in the next over: two balls were hit over his head for sixes, and a wide down the leg beat Kumar Sangakkara to the fence. Murali pulled things back somewhat next over, and Australia reached 98 with only 22 overs left. How much would they score against Murali, Vaas, Malinga, and Dilhara?Gilchrist cleared long-off against Dilhara; slog-swept Murali into the stands; late-cut Dilhara past Sangakkara for four; and after Vaas bowled a tight over, Hayden — who had gone almost unnoticed till then — put everything behind one from Malinga: it was not a poor ball, and neither was it well-timed; it still soared over long-off into the stands.Two balls later Gilchrist reached his hundred — off 72 balls — with a slap over mid-off. He edged the next ball, Sangakkara flung himself to his left, but could only reach it with his fingertips. The Sri Lankans went up in unison, but Sangakkara — who had earned quite a name for appealing for everything — admitted that he had grassed the chance.Vaas went off radar next over as Gilchrist smashed two fours, punctuated by five wides. Gilchrist hit consecutive boundaries off Malinga next over before taking a single — and the unthinkable happened: Hayden tried to clear extra-cover but could only hole out to a jumping Mahela at cover.Australia’s score read 172 after the 23rd over, but Sri Lanka conceded a mere 14 off the next three, regaining some control over proceedings. Then Sanath Jayasuriya darted one at his legs, and Gilchrist swiped it over mid-wicket for another violent sweep, and hit Jayasuriya for a six and a four in consecutive balls shortly afterwards.Then Dilhara struck, making amends for his earlier lapse. Gilchrist tried an almighty hoick but could only top-edge it to Chamara Silva at mid-wicket. Gilchrist’s 149 had taken him 104 balls, and had included 13 fours and 8 sixes. After Dilhara’s drop he had scored 118 from 74 balls. It still remains the highest score in a World Cup final.Sanath, Sanga, and rainSome frantic hitting followed as Ponting and Andrew Symonds added 37 from 31 balls. Shane Watson did not last, and Australia finished on 281 for 4, managing a mere 57 from 45 balls after Gilchrist’s departure. Such was the impact of Gilchrist’s innings that Australia managed a run rate of 7.39 despite the other batsmen managing a mere 109 from 127 balls.The first ball of the Sri Lankan innings saw an outrageous shot. Upul Tharanga walked down, Hayden-style, and cover-drove Nathan Bracken for four. He did not last long: caught in two minds, Tharanga was stuck at the crease and edged one to Gilchrist off Bracken.This brought Jayasuriya and Sangakkara, perhaps the most dangerous Sri Lankan batsmen, together. They had a cautious start, reaching 53 after 12 overs (Sri Lanka needed 229 from 168 balls at this stage) before Jayasuriya hit three fours off an over from Watson. Sangakkara responded in style, dispatching Glenn McGrath over mid-wicket before cover-driving and pulling him for fours of the next two balls. They had taken 29 off 2 overs, and 200 from 156 did not look too difficult.The pair slowed down after the mini-explosion, reaching 117 after 19 overs (165 from 114 was quite gettable with nine wickets in hand). Jayasuriya had reached his fifty meanwhile; Sangakkara unleashed one of his trademark cover-drives against Brad Hogg, but holed out to Ponting at short mid-wicket next ball. He had scored 54 from 52, and Sri Lanka needed 159 from 109.Michael Clarke picked up the big wicket as Jayasuriya went for a wild swipe, only to see his off-stump pegged back; his 63 had taken him 67 balls. The light deteriorated shortly afterwards and the rain came back with Sri Lanka on 149 for 3 after 24.5 overs: the Duckworth-Lewis par score read 175 after 25 overs. The target was adjusted to 269 from 36 overs, which meant Sri Lanka had to score 120 more from 67 balls. Certainly not impossible.Then Jayawardene fell, trapped leg-before by Watson, and though both Silva and Dilshan hit a few attractive strokes (Bracken helped by missing a caught-and-bowled chance of Silva) the latter was dismissed by an excellent throw from Clarke. The target read 81 from 36; impossible?Silva went after Clarke next over and was bowled; Russel Arnold, playing his last international match, edged one to Gilchrist off McGrath; and though Malinga walked out and hit a six, Sri Lanka were left to score 74 off 24. Then the light faded out, again; the moon had come out. Light was offered, and both Vaas and Malinga accepted it.A farcical finishAustralia had definitely won the match on Duckworth-Lewis. Out came the stands, and just as the Sri Lankans were about to walk off and the Australians had started celebrating, Dar walked up to them, informing the Australians that they had not won the World Cup. Yet.Billy Bowden, the reserve umpire, joined the fray (though Rudi Koertzen, the third umpire, stayed back), as did Mahela. As per rules, if bad light had stopped play, the match would have had to be finished on the reserve day, which meant the Australians would have to come back again to bowl those four overs before they could lift the World Cup.Jayawardene and Ponting reached a consensus: while Ponting would use only his slow bowlers, Sri Lankans would not go all out after them. Malinga was stumped off Symonds sixth ball after play resumed, but Vaas and Dilhara played out the four overs. Sri Lanka finished on 215 for eight and lost by 53 runs.Australia finally lifted the World Cup — amidst moonlight — though not after the four umpires and match referee Jeff Crowe were booed for the farcical finish. Everton Weekes presented the Man of the Match award to Gilchrist, while Garry Sobers, whose arrival was met with unanimous tumultuous cheer, gave the Man of the Series to McGrath, who had the best line of the evening: “Bit dark at the moment, but loving every minute”.What followed?– Bucknor, Dar, Koertzen, Bowden, and Crowe were all suspended from the inaugural ICC World T20 later that year for a fault that was not theirs.
– McGrath never played another international match.Brief scores:Australia 281 for 4 in 38 overs (Adam Gilchrist 149) beat Sri Lanka 215 for 8 in 36 overs (Sanath Jayasuriya 63, Kumar Sangakkara 54) by 53 runs (Duckworth-Lewis method).Man of the Match: Adam Gilchrist.

Ever since her cancer diagnosis, Tahira has constantly shared with her fans everything about her journey of battling cancer. From her first thoughts to the acceptance of the reality to braving it all along with her husband Ayushmann Khurrana's support, Tahira has talked about it all. In her most recent post, Tahira has shared a carousel of her different hairstyles during her cancer treatment. Short crop, losing her hair and going bald, Tahira has opened up about it all with a message of self-love, acceptance and the urge to do away with the set notions of beauty. Her elaborate post details how the last couple of months have been an “extreme case of metamorphosis” for her. Not categorising it as to whether it was “caterpillar to a butterfly or vice versa,” Tahira has shared that each stage has brought with it tremendous changes to her – not just mentally, but physically too. “From my obsession with long hair, associating beauty with rapunzel tresses, and hiding most of the time behind my hair (as I felt secure, lest my crooked nose, or freckles or pimples or simply not so chiseled face isn’t exposed) to losing my hair, wearing extensions and a cap, going bald to now a short crop. I am enjoying every phase because somehow with hair I lost my insecurity, my stupid notion of beauty and my complexes,” read her post.  
Sharing that she doesn't know yet whether she'll keep her hair long or short, Tahira is sure of one thing – that she is not going to hide her face anymore. “I don’t claim to have refined beauty, but I have changed my own mindset and my biggest victory is changing the mindset and perception of my 7 year-old-son, the next generation. From running to get a cap and placing it on my head when I was losing my hair and had a bald patch to proudly introducing me to his friends when I was bald or now with short hair, I feel I am a part of a change,” she wrote in her caption. With hashtags like 'Ki farak painda hai' to 'breast cancer awareness' and 'bald head', Tahira dedicated her post to “women of all shapes and sizes” and to everyone who've shared their frets and fears on losing hair during or after chemotherapy. Soon after her post, Tahira received messages of love and strength from her industry colleagues. While Esha Gupta shared that she's seen this with her mother, cousin and now her, Sonali, who herself has battled cancer, sent her strength, sunshine, and rainbow in her comment.

The April 17 elections were the first time the country of 260 million people combined the presidential vote with national and regional parliamentary ones, with an aim to cut costs. Voting was largely peaceful and was estimated to have drawn 80 percent of the total 193 million voters, who each had to punch up to five ballot papers in over 800,000 polling stations.  But conducting the eight-hour vote in a country that stretches more than 5,000 km (3,000 miles) from its western to eastern tips proven to be both a Herculean logistical feat and deadly for officials, who had to count ballot papers by hand. As of Saturday night, 272 election officials had died, mostly from overwork-related illnesses, while 1,878 others had fallen ill, said Arief Priyo Susanto, spokesman of the General Elections Commission (KPU). The Health Ministry issued a circular letter on April 23 urging health facilities to give utmost care for sick election staff, while the Finance Ministry is working on compensation for families of the deceased, Susanto added. The KPU has come under fire due to the rising death toll. “The KPU is not prudent in managing the workload of staff,” said Ahmad Muzani, deputy chairman of the campaign of opposition presidential candidate Prabowo Subianto, reported by news website Kumparan.com. Prabowo, who independent pollsters said was the loser of the 2019 polls based on quick counts, had alleged widespread cheating and his campaign claimed some officials punched ballots in favor of incumbent President Joko Widodo. Widodo’s security minister said the allegations were baseless. Both candidates have declared victory, though quick counts suggested Widodo won the election by around 9-10 percentage points. The KPU will conclude vote counting and announce winners of the presidential and parliamentary elections on May 22.

""We'll provide Ukrainian citizenship [to people] who suffer from authoritarian regimes. In the first place, the Russians, who probably suffer most,"" he added.",Reuters,"KIEV (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin should not expect many Ukrainians to take up his offer of a Russian passport, Ukraine’s President-elect Volodymyr Zelenskiy said, while offering Ukrainian citizenship to Russians. Putin said on Saturday Moscow was considering offering all Ukrainian citizens fast-tracked Russian passports, a move likely to anger some politicians in Ukraine which has been at war with pro-Russian separatists since 2014. “Ukraine’s difference, in particular, is in the fact that we, Ukrainians, have freedom of speech in our country, free media, and Internet,” Zelenskiy said on Facebook. “We will provide Ukrainian citizenship to representatives of all peoples who suffer from authoritarian and corrupt regimes. In the first place - the Russians, who today suffer probably the most,” he added. Putin made his statement days after signing an order to simplify the procedure for obtaining a Russian passport for residents of separatist-controlled eastern Ukraine, prompting calls from Kiev for more international sanctions. Five years of war between Ukrainian troops and Russian-backed forces have killed 13,000 people despite a notional ceasefire signed in 2015. The Russian leader said he also wanted to know Zelenskiy’s position on the conflict in eastern Ukraine, saying he had the impression that Zelenskiy would not implement the terms of a peace deal sealed in Minsk in 2015 despite Ukrainians being tired of the war. Zelenskiy said he was ready for talks but he warned Russia against trying to speak with Ukraine and Ukrainians “in the language of threats, military and economic pressure”.  “This is not the best path to ceasefire and unblocking the Minsk process,” he said. “From our side, we are ready to discuss new conditions for the coexistence of Ukraine and Russia.

Since taking office, Trump has enacted a number of pro-Israel policies, like moving the US’ Israeli Embassy to Jerusalem, withdrawing from the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran, and recognizing Israel’s sovereignty over the disputed Golan Heights region.Some of Trump’s opponents have been blasted for pointing out the extent of the influence Israel has on the American leadership. Freshman Congresswoman Ilhan Omar was twice accused of anti-Semitism in the last two months, after she suggested the US’ support for Israel was “all about the Benjamins,” and accused Jewish Americans of harboring a ‘dual loyalty’ to Israel.If you like this story, share it with a friend!",https://www.rt.com/usa/457732-new-york-times-antisemitic-cartoon/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
20061,Govt may ban Deloitte for 5 yrs over alleged IL&FS misconduct: Report,"The government may reportedly invoke Section 140(5) of the Companies Act to ban Deloitte for five years over its alleged malpractice in the IL&FS audit. If this happens, it'd be the second such case after Price Waterhouse (PW) was banned in Satyam scam. In 2018, SEBI banned PW from auditing listed companies and market intermediaries for two years.",The Quint,"Even as Deloitte Haskins and Sells remains perched precariously on the high wire over its questionable role in the IL&FS audit process, it appears that the Ministry of Corporate Affairs may invoke Section 140 (5) of the Companies Act to debar the firm for alleged malpractice in IL&FS accounts.Section 140 (5) of the Companies Act essentially looks at the following:Without prejudice to any action under the provisions of this Act or any other law for the time being in force, the Tribunal either suo motu or on an application made to it by the Central Government or by any person concerned, if it is satisfied that the auditor of a company has, whether directly or indirectly, acted in a fraudulent manner or abetted or colluded in any fraud by, or in relation to, the company or its directors or officers, it may, by order, direct the company to change its auditors.Also Read : Former IL&FS Managing Director and CEO Ramesh Bawa ArrestedNow, if this were to happen, it will be the second such instance after Price Waterhouse (PW) was nailed in the Satyam scam last year.In January, 2018, nine years after the Satyam scandal stunned corporate India, SEBI banned Price Waterhouse (PW) from providing audit services to listed companies and market intermediaries for two years in the Satyam fraud. Two PW partners were banned for three years.The three entities also have to pay 12 percent interest on the disgorgement amount since 7 January 2009, in 45 days from the date of the order. Further, it said that no listed company or intermediary registered with SEBI to be engaged with any audit firm associated with the PW network for issuing any certificate with respect to compliance of statutory obligations which SEBI is competent to administer and enforce, under various laws for a period of two years. These entities were charged under SEBI prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices (FUTP) regulation.When contacted, Deloitte spokesperson told IANS:According to sources, the Group's defaults began in May 2018. The three principal arms of IL&FS Group - IL&FS, ITNL and IFIN – according to sources within Deloitte saw SRBC &CO (Ernst & Young) audit two of the firms in both 2017-18 and 2018-19, namely IL&FS and ITNL. IFIN meanwhile was audited by BSR (KPMG) in 2018-19, DHS (Deloitte) and BSR (KPMG).In 2016-17 DHS audited IL&FS, ITNL along with SRBC &Co (E&Y) and IFIN on its own. Of course, till 2015-16 for many years DHS audited all three Group entities.Trying to maintain distance from the opaque architecture of the 347 subsidiaries - majority of them overseas – Deloitte has clarified that they were audited by various smaller firms, most of them being non Big Four. It has also emerged that during the many years that Deloitte was auditing the Group, secured loans were sufficiently collaterised which in turn was independently valued by reputable parties such as Knight Frank or realty and NM Raiji.Also Read : PFs including of army have exposure to IL&FS: Uday KotakThe value of the assets and loans was corroborated by the fact that in 2015-16, Piramal Group had proposed to acquire a stake in IL&FS at Rs 750 a share after commissioning a detailed due diligence exercise by KPMG.Similarly, Deloitte has claimed that they did not audit the financial statements of 111 subsidiaries, 36 jointly controlled entities, 11 associates in 2016-17, or the financial information of 13 subsidiaries, two jointly controlled entities or six associates.

The Congress candidate would obviously be bound by the party’s dictate. Moreover, much of the state’s special status was obliterated by the Congress party, and what was left was subsequently surrendered by PDP before BJP for the lust of power,” he said.“We have (PDP president) Mehbooba (Mufti) in the fray as well, whose political slyness and bankruptcy is known to all.

The move clears the path for an initial Starlink launch ""no earlier than"" May, the company said.  Theoretically, the lower flight path allows coverage with fewer satellites, lowers latency and reduces the chances of space debris.Companies like OneWeb and Kepler Communications had objected to SpaceX's request over concerns that Starlink would interfere with their own satellites, but the FCC didn't believe the satellites would create ""significant"" interference.  Regulators also didn't find a significant risk of collisions in the new orbit, noting that each of the satellites would have thrusters to make evasive maneuvers.For SpaceX, the approval might come in the nick of time.  In addition to competitors like OneWeb, the company is facing impending rivalries like Amazon's 3,236 planned internet satellites.

Thus, the election commission officials kept it pending and made it clear that he wouldn’t be able to vote. It was informed that his application will be considered for the next elections.AdvertisementThis came as a massive disappointment to the cricketer as well as the fans. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, a few weeks ago, has urged many celebrities to cast their votes and also inspire the fans to do so. This list of celebrities included Virat Kohli as well and apparently, he tried to call up the election commission several times to get his name on the list.

In the first complaint, Delhi BJP spokesperson Parveen Shakar Kapoor said the facts presented by Kejriwal were incorrect and provoking. “In the radio advertisement, the CM can be heard electorally provoking the people of Delhi that the Central government collects thousands of crores of rupees in revenue from Delhi but gives back around partly Rs 325 crore,” reads the complaint letter.It claimed that the Centre allocates around Rs 40,000- Rs 50,000 crore for the service, welfare, and betterment of Delhiites every year. “It is the Central government which maintains the Delhi Police, spending Rs 7,881 crore annually on it for maintaining law and order of the city, and spends around Rs 40,000 crore annually on Delhi Metro, road infrastructure, Yamuna cleaning, hospitals, Delhi University etc., which directly benefits the people of Delhi.”FOLLOW OUR FULL ELECTION COVERAGE HEREThe BJP has requested the election commissioner to review the contents of the advertisement and block it, if the objection is found valid. In another complaint, BJP’s national secretary RP Singh and advocate Neeraj said Kejriwal, by referring to BJP chief Amit Shah’s statement on driving out infiltrators, was trying to win Muslim votes by misleading them and appealing to their religious sentiments.“Citing the BJP’s elections manifesto, Shah had on April 10 said that with the help of the National Register of Citizens, the party would drive out infiltrators from India and protect the Hindus, Sikhs and Buddhists.

            “We have a right to approach the courts seeking action over model code violations… we can exercise that option… the mega policeman has turned a blind eye,” Singhvi said, adding that silence can be construed as approval.Taking a jibe at the poll panel, he said the Congress is saddened to say that it seems that from the second word of Election Commission, ‘C’ has been dropped, and it has become “Election Omission” for the Modi-Shah duo.Singhvi wondered whether Modi and Shah are outside the ambit of the Model Code of Conduct, which he dubbed as “Modi code of conduct”.He claimed that the two leaders have violated the poll code broadly under three categories: polarisation of votes, invoking armed forces in campaigns and taking out rallies on election days.“The EC has taken action against several leaders for violating the poll code based on our complaints. We appreciate that. Since the precedent has been set, why not take action against Modi and Shah,” he said.“We are sad to say that the Modi-Shah duo has become a kind of an arch of immunity as far as the Election Commission’s jurisdiction goes, as far as the Model Code of Conduct goes,” Singhvi said.Never has there been a more “audacious set of individuals” who for petty electoral gains have turned a blind eye to the existence of the EC, poll code and the Constitution, he alleged.“I can understand the selfish petty motives of the party in power, but, what we cannot understand is how the mega policemen, the Election Commission, for this 50-day window of elections turned a blind eye to such egregious, wanton, unashamed conduct day in and day out,” Singhvi said.“I salute them (EC) for acting on our complaint, where I have personally appeared and argued for the same issues I gave three categories hate speech, armed forces and doing campaigning while voting,” the Congress leader said.On two of these issues, the EC had passed orders prohibiting or curtailing campaigning activities, he said, citing the case of Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath.The chief minister was barred by the EC from campaigning for 72 hours.Singhvi said in the past 25 days, he has personally led at least 15 delegations to the commission.He urged the poll panel to follow its own orders and precedents while looking into the complaints against Modi and Shah.The Congress leader said are there “two laws in this country for the prime minister and for Amit Shah on the one hand and for others on the other”.“Is there a discriminatory application by their tomb-like silence on these two persons? Is the EC not directly, not tacitly, directly accepting endorsing and supporting such conduct?” he asked.“Therefore, we are now complaining through you (EC) only when the water has risen above our head. The people of India demand an explanation for this inaction, for this silence and although we are doing everything in our power, including, if necessary, moving court. The point is why is the Election Commission not doing anything,” Singhvi said.By not doing anything, the poll panel is in fact deciding by default, he alleged.Responding to questions on reported remarks by Congress leaders PC Chacko and Shatrughan Sinha on Yasin Malik and Mohammed Ali Jinnah respectively, he said while Sinha has clarified his comments, it would be better if Chacko was approached directly on the issue.",https://www.india.com/lok-sabha-elections-2019-india/model-code-of-conduct-has-become-modi-code-of-conduct-congress-3643568/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

20102,Shoaib Akhtar was the first bowler to bowl over 100mph,"Ex-Pakistani pacer Shoaib Akhtar was the first player to bowl over 100mph, recording 100.04mph (161kmph) in an ODI against New Zealand on April 27, 2002. However, the record remained unofficial since ICC refused to sanction it as they did not have a standard measuring tool. In 2003, Akhtar went on to bowl the fastest delivery in recorded history, clocking 161.3kmph.",Cricket Country,"The approaching storm…Shoaib Akhtar running into to bowl his thunderbolts © Getty ImagesOn April 27, 2002, Shoaib Akhtar became the first man in the history of international cricket to cross the 100-mile barrier, but the International Cricket Council refused to recognise the feat, stating it wasn’t picked off a standard measuring tool. Karthik Parimal takes a trip down memory lane to see what the decision meant to Shoaib and how he repeated the insanity an year later.“Fast bowling is about imposing yourself on the batsman,” said Waqar Younis a few months ago. The authenticity of this statement needs no verification, for its source is one who was trained to bowl at tearaway speeds during the initial stages of his career, and mastered it in due course of time. It was a trait Waqar passed to many in the Pakistani line-up, and the examples of it are well-documented. During latter stages, when he was assigned the task of leading the side, Waqar played a more sedate, yet effective, role with ball, leaving the likes of Shoaib Akhtar to ‘impose’ themselves on the batsmen with sheer pace.A decade ago, Shoaib and Brett Lee were the only two speedsters who were touted to break the 100 mph barrier; or at least to hover around the speed with which West Indies and the English pacers of the 1970s and ’80s consistently bowled at. Yet, the previous fastest delivery that was recorded, albeit not during an international or a domestic fixture, was that of Jeff Thomson’s — 99.8 mph in 1976. In his book, The Art of Fast Bowling, Dennis Lillee states that, in 1975, Thomson bowled at 160.45 kph, which amounts to 99.7 mph. However, “very accurate high speed cameras” and a close study of the best fast bowlers in the world — Lillee, Michael Holding, Wayne Daniel, Bob Willis, John Snow and Andy Roberts, to name a few — had revealed that none ever recorded a speed of 100 mph or over.The day that frontier was conqueredIn the April of 2002, in the bustling city of Lahore, New Zealand met Pakistan for the third and final One-Day International (ODI) — although it was inconsequential, for the hosts had already lapped up the first two matches — of the abridged series. Having elected to bat, Pakistan scored 278 in their 50 overs, thereby setting a formidable total for the Kiwis to chase (this was before Twenty20 had become rampant). The new-ball bowlers were Waqar and Shoaib, and while the former was meticulously working away at the openers, the latter was wayward but, without a shadow of doubt, quick. Any delivery directed at the body had the batsman hopping at the crease like a cat on a hot tin roof.He seldom took his foot off the gas pedal on that eventful day, consistently clocking a little over 99 mph. One such delivery to No.3 batsman Craig McMillan was recorded at 99.3 mph (159 kph).  Another ball, as indicated by the speed gun provided by one of the sponsors, was clocked at 100.04 mph (161 kph). This caused great joy for many associated with Pakistan cricket, since one of their own lads was the first to break into uncharted territory.Khalid Butt, the Pakistan Cricket Board’s Media Manager, released the following statement post the game that saw Pakistan win by 66 runs: “According to the speed gun operated in the ground by a sponsor, Shoaib Akhtar bowled a delivery at a speed of 161kph during the third ODI between Pakistan and New Zealand at Gaddafi Stadium, Lahore.”Or was it?Nevertheless, the International Cricket Council (ICC) refused to recognise this feat, for they didn’t have a standard measuring tool. Clarifying that they never kept any official records about bowling speeds, then ICC spokesman David Clarke clearly stated that ‘it’s not an officially recognised record.’Questions were raised with regards to the accuracy of the recorder too. The case of a malfunction wasn’t ruled out either. This prompted CyberNet, the sponsor of the speed gun for that series, to release a media statement that read as follows: “The Speed Radar Gun was used in all the three One-Day Internationals played in Pakistan. The accuracy of the Speed Radar Gun is authentic and reliable as it can be tested with an internationally used speed checking device. We have no interests of claiming any ‘World Records’ or any ‘Official records’ and are acting in the best interest of the game of cricket. On the third One-Day International at Lahore our Speed Radar Gun showed Shoaib Akhtar’s delivery at 161kph in his second over.”One year later, it’s officialDespite the hullabaloo that followed, the verdict from the head honchos wasn’t ruled in Shoaib’s favour. Nonetheless, one year later, during the 2003 World Cup, on February 22 against England at Cape Town, he bowled at 161.3 kph (100.23 mph) and, ostensibly, signalled to the powers that be that he had now done it twice. “The media has highlighted my ‘exploits’ both on and off the field, ensuring that my personal life was well documented, even if not always accurately. But I was the first to cross the 100-mile barrier, twice, and am still the fastest bowler in the world, having set an official world record by achieving the fastest delivery ever, clocking in at 161.3 kmph (100.2 mph),” recalls Shoaib in his autobiography Controversially Yours.A few bowlers — notably Shaun Tait, Brett Lee and Mohammad Sami — have clocked speeds over 160 kph, but, like was Akhtar’s first case, they hadn’t been picked off a standard measuring tool.(Karthik Parimal, a Correspondent with CricketCountry, is a cricket aficionado and a worshipper of the game.

""When my father wasn't well and admitted in hospital, he ate food kept for cows to provide food for me so I could train. I still cannot accept or forget it,"" she said.",The News Minute,"“My father ate the food kept for cattle in order to provide me with decent food so that I can train for athletics,” said a tearful Gomathi Marimuthu at a press meet on Friday in Chennai.India’s golden woman Gomathi Marimuthu recalled her struggles to reach the pinnacle of success in the 800-metres track event at the recently concluded Asian Athletic Championships in Doha, Qatar. In a press meet organized by the Velammal School in Chennai after a felicitation function for the sportswoman, 30-year-old Gomathi shared her journey so far and the road ahead.Hardwork bore her fruitsSpeaking to reporters, Gomathi says she was confident about winning a gold medal despite not getting help from the Indian government. “I was confident about winning a medal and had practiced well. I was not part of the camp for a month and trained alone. Government of India did not help me and I got ready in my own money,” she said adding that Indian coach Bhatia helped her out with workout schedule over the phone.Recalling her experience at the Asian Athletic Championships in Doha, Gomathi noted that it has been a difficult period in the run up to the meet. “If government of Tamil Nadu helps me, I will train hard and try and win an Olympics medal. There is still one year for the event. Since this event was in a short period and I was recovering from an injury, I couldn’t clock my best timing in the race.”Not one to mince words, Gomathi said that she does not want anybody to suffer like she did during her training period. “I had to fight for my rights at every step. I have seen many athletes give up because they did not have the help or the resources needed to prepare. I would be happy if government helps them,” she pointed out.  She also shared that many Tamils living in Doha have come forward to help her out financially and that she is considering accepting their help.“Now government of Tamil Nadu has come forward to help me. The DMK and the government of India have also offered to help me,” she adds.Speaking about how she had always loved representing Tamil Nadu in athletic meets, Gomathi said that she used to tell small lies to those who pointed out that she was supposed to represent Karnataka in events, since she is employed in the Income Tax Department in Bengaluru. “I used to tell small lies to my seniors at office, something like I didn’t get entry, this and that. I feel happy to get the support of all the people in Tamil Nadu,” Gomathi says with a smile.Her father’s sacrificesIf there was one person that Gomathi truly misses at this point in her career, it is her father, Marimuthu, who passed away a few years ago. She fondly remembered the sacrifices he made to enable her train well for competitions.“My father was not able to walk when I was training for the championship. We don’t have bus or light facilities in my village. So to catch the bus at 4.30, my father used to wake me up at 4am and help me with household work if my mother is not well. I miss him,” she says.Remembering one particular incident which is still etched in the memory of her father, Gomathi said, “When my father was not well and admitted in the hospital, he ate the food kept for cattle just because he wanted to provide food for me for sports training I still cannot accept or forget it. If he was alive now, I would have considered him as my God,"" she adds, breaking into tears. “He used to tell me that I have chances to win the gold. I was in the second position till the last 50 metres (in the Asian championships). In the last 50 metres, I raced ahead and was able to win the gold, which was possible only through my hard work. I was so happy to know that I had finished first. More so when I heard that I was the first medal for India in the championship,” she recalls.Her performance in the Asian Athletic meet was not only medal-winning, but also her personal best, she states. “In my age, it is not easy to clock a best timing. But I did and I am happy. If I work harder, I can do better. My target is to clock a record timing in the upcoming World Championship. If I perform well in this World Championships, there are chances that I might win medal in Olympics,” she added.  WATCH: ",https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/my-father-ate-food-kept-cattle-so-i-can-train-gomathi-marimuthu-s-emotional-presser-100821?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

20126,Sony warns of low annual profit as PS4 sales slow down,"After two years of record profits, Japanese multinational conglomerate Sony has warned of a sharper-than-expected drop in annual profit amid slowdown of its gaming business and PlayStation 4 (PS4) console sales. Sony sold around 17.8 million PS4 in 2018, down from 19 million in 2017. Sony's global smartphone market share is less than 1%, research portal Statista had recently claimed.",Reuters,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Sony Corp warned of a sharper-than-expected drop in its annual profit and scrapped some longer-term targets, in a sign a slowdown in its gaming business as its PlayStation 4 console nears the end of its life was beginning to hurt. The bleak outlook comes after two years of record profits and underlines concerns a turnaround is losing steam at Sony - which bet on entertainment and gaming for steady revenues after battling years of losses with consumer electronics, such as TV sets, that are more susceptible to price competition. Analysts widely expect Sony to launch a next-generation console in 2020 to replace the five-year old PlayStation 4 (PS4), but the business could face tough competition with new video game streaming services from Alphabet Inc’s Google and Apple. Sony’s finance chief, however, shrugged off concerns about the threat of cloud-based gaming. “With over 90 million customers enjoying the (PS4) platform, we have a sense of market trends,” Hiroki Totoki said at a briefing on Friday. The Japanese firm forecast profit for the year through March 2020 at 810 billion yen ($7.25 billion), down 9.4 percent from 894.2 billion yen a year earlier and below an average forecast of 834.49 billion yen from 22 analysts polled by Refinitiv. Sony withdrew its earnings goals for individual businesses for the year to March 2021, including an estimated profit range of 130 billion-170 billion yen for gaming, citing “significant changes to the operating environment.” For the financial year to March 2020, Sony expects costs for developing the new console to push its gaming profits down to 280 billion yen from 311 billion yen a year earlier. PS4 sales are forecast to drop 10 percent to 16 million units. The semiconductor business, which includes image sensors, is expected to report a profit of 145 billion yen, up a billion yen from a year earlier. Sony’s image sensors, central to its revival, are used by Apple and other major smartphone makers. Sony remains bullish about demand for large-size image sensors and multiple-lens camera systems for smartphones, and said it may spend 100 billion yen more to build a new facility. However, Sony shares, which have lost more than 30 percent from their 11-year highs set in September last year, underling growing worries about the company’s strategy. Daniel Loeb’s hedge fund Third Point LLC is building a stake in Sony again to push for changes that include shedding some businesses, Reuters has reported. Third Point wants Sony to explore options for some of its business units, including its movie studio, which the fund believes has attracted takeover interest, according to sources familiar with the matter.  CFO Totoki declined to comment on the report. A Jefferies analyst, Atul Goyal, however, said in a note last week that the “recent reports of activist investors’ interest and stake acquisition is likely to put significant, desirable and sustained pressure on Sony to act”. Sony CEO Kenichiro Yoshida “made some very tough but desirable decisions” to revive the company when he was finance chief, but his decisions since he became CEO “appear slightly benign”, the analyst added. The company should exit the money-losing smartphone business, while keeping the pictures business, which has potential for a turnaround, Goyal added.

20140,India hikes wheat import duty to 40% to support local farmers,"The government on Friday said it has raised import duty on wheat to 40% from 30% in a bid to support local farmers. Indian flour millers imported 1.65 million tonnes of wheat in 2017-18 fiscal year, down from 5.7 million tonnes the year before. India's wheat production is estimated to rise by 2% in 2018-19 to record 99.12 million tonnes.",Reuters,"MUMBAI (Reuters) - India has raised its import duty on wheat to 40 percent from 30 percent, the government said late on Friday, as the world’s No. 2 producer of the grain tries to support local farmers.  The step comes as Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s party looks to contain rural discontent due to lower crop prices amid voting in a general election that began on April 11 and ends on May 19. Local wheat prices have fallen over 11 percent in 2019 due to ample supply from last year’s crop and forecasts of record output. The hike in duty is likely to make imports of wheat unviable for flour mills even after recent declines in global prices, potentially dragging further on global grain markets. “Local wheat production is higher. The government is now trying to ensure prices remain above support levels,” said Harish Galipelli, head of commodities and currencies at Inditrade Derivatives & Commodities in Mumbai. India has raised the price at which it buys new-season wheat from local farmers by 6 percent to 1,840 rupees per 100 kg for 2019. The government usually purchases about a quarter of such wheat from farmers at state-set prices to build stocks to run a major food welfare programme. India’s wheat production will rise 2 percent in 2019 from the year before to a record 99.12 million tonnes, according to estimates from the country’s agriculture department. Only one wheat crop is grown in India each year, with planting starting in late October and harvesting in March. Government wheat stocks stood at 17 million tonnes as of April 1, up nearly 30 percent from the same time a year ago. “At 40 percent import duty, imports are not viable for flour mills. They have to buy local crop,” said a Mumbai-based grain dealer with a global trading firm. He declined to be identified as he was not authorised to speak with media. Indian flour millers imported 1.65 million tonnes of wheat in the 2017/18 fiscal year, down from 5.7 million tonnes the year before. Those shipments were mainly from Australia, Russia and Ukraine.

(I request you with folded hands, don’t drag me into caste politics. The 130 crore people of this country are my family),” Prime Minister Modi said while addressing a rally here.“I had never spoken about my caste. Till the time the Opposition leaders hurled abuses on me, the country didn’t know my caste. But I am thankful to ‘Behenji’ (Mayawati), Akhilesh, Congress and the ‘Mahamilawati’, that they are openly talking about my backwardness,” he said.“Meri jaati to itni choti hai, gaon mein ek-adh ghar bhi nahi hota hai. Mai to pichda nahi, ati-pichde mein paida hua hu, aap mere munh se bulwa rahi ho isliye bol raha hu… Jab mera desh pichda (backward) hai to agda(forward) kya hota hai. Mujhe to pure desh ko agda banana hai,” he added.During the poll rally, the Prime Minister emphasised that terrorism is the biggest issue in today's world.“It is the biggest threat for India. It has been the biggest target of terrorism. Various terror outfits are still there in Pakistan (Aatank ki factoryian Pakistan me chal rahi hain),” he said.“Does SP-BSP have a formula to tackle terrorism? Have they once said anything about terrorism in Lok Sabha elections? They hurled 100 abuses against Modi, but did they even give 10 cuss words against terrorism? Why so? People of SP and BSP should clarify whether they are afraid of terrorists or they stay quiet to rescue them. Did those, who are dreaming of becoming the Prime Minister, put forth any scheme to make the country strong or for the security of our Jawans?” he asked.Talking about the Balta House encounter, Modi said, “Should we expect something from those who consider Pakistan’s lie as truth, make it a hero and ask for proofs from our Jawans, just to defeat Modi? These are the people who cried when terrorists were killed in Batla House encounter.”Batla House encounter took place on September 19, 2008, against Indian Mujahideen (IM) terrorists in Batla House locality in Delhi's Jamia Nagar.Two suspected terrorists, Atif Ameen and Mohammad Sajid, were killed while two other suspects, Mohammad Saif and Zeeshan, were arrested. In Kannauj, polling will be held on April 29 and counting of votes will take place on May 23.

Jofra Archer ended his IPL 2019 campaign on a high by hitting a four and a six in his 27* to take RR to an improbable win over the opposition.Stokes, on the other hand, has now had two back-to-back lacklustre IPL seasons. He had made 196 runs and took 8 wickets in 13 matches in the IPL 2018 when RR made it into the playoffs. But the performance became worse, as he managed just 123 runs and 6 wickets in 9 matches in this season. This performance is far removed from his IPL 2017 performance for Rising Pune Supergiants, for whom he made 316 runs in just 12 matches and picked 12 wickets, helping them make it into the finals.AdvertisementBen Stokes has been named in the England squad for both the ICC World Cup 2019 and for the upcoming five-match ODI series against Pakistan, along with Jofra Archer and their stint came to an end on Thursday, the duo flew back on Friday morning to join the English squad for the pre-World Cup camp.Though Stokes’ form was patchy at best, RR will miss his services in their upcoming matches as they starve to make a final dash towards the final four finish. Currently, Royals are on the seventh spot with 4 wins from 11 matches and 8 points. “I think everybody would want to be consistent, but you take it as it comes. Everyone wants to go out and do their best every time, but sometimes it doesn’t come off and you just wipe out that part. Also, if you do well, you can’t live off that,” Stokes was quoted as saying by Hindustan Times.Stokes was highly emotional during the celebration of win over KKR and in the dressing room, made a heartfelt speech, which was shared by Rajasthan Royals on their official Twitter account.

20147,JadhavÂ’s IPL form not a cause of concern for WC: Stephen Fleming,"Chennai Super Kings coach Stephen Fleming said that CSK all-rounder Kedar Jadhav's form in the current edition of the IPL is not a cause of concern for the Indian team at the World Cup 2019. ""There are expectations from him to play a key role... Jadhav has the finishing ability to manipulate the field,"" Fleming added.",CricTracker,"Chennai Super Kings has looked a totally different unit whenever MS Dhoni has not played for them in the ongoing IPL. First against SRH and now against MI, the CSK team faltered badly, and lost by 46 runs in Friday’s contest. Their score of 109 was their lowest at home, concerning the coaching staff of the batting backup without Dhoni.Head coach Stephen Fleming opined that Kedar Jadhav, who managed just 6 runs and has not been in the kind of form a player should be who is going to the World Cup shortly. Playing in at no.6, he has a very good chance to play himself in and get CSK to the target of 157 runs, but couldn’t do much as he chopped a Krunal Pandya delivery on his stumps.AdvertisementKedar Jadhav has played only one inning of substance, a 58 against MI in Wankhede, which came in as a defeat. He has not been bowling in the IPL to manage his workload and hamstring issue. “He would like to do more. He is building towards a World Cup as well. There are expectations of him to play a key role. But we need a little bit more from him. Jadhav has the finishing ability to manipulate the field, but he is good enough to play an anchor role as well,” coach Fleming was quoted as saying by Sportstar.In 12 matches of the ongoing IPL, Jadhav has managed just 168 runs at an average of 20.25 and strike rate of 96.42 and has hit just 3 sixes and 19 fours. Such form is a concern for Indian team management, as he along with Hardik Pandya forms the crux of lower order batting and forms the sixth bowler.“He is disappointed that he hasn’t made most of the opportunities he got. We have been losing many wickets which suggests that most players are in search of form. T20 is a hard game to play and it demands consistency when you play down the order,” Fleming said further.Jadhav will have more games to come through for the Chennai franchise, given that they play Delhi Capitals at home on May 1 after a gap of four days’ time.",https://www.crictracker.com/ipl-2019-kedar-jadhavs-ipl-form-not-a-cause-of-concern-for-world-cup-says-stephen-fleming/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

20152,Amazon admits its system can fire underperforming staff itself,"Amazon uses an automated employee-tracking system to monitor the performance of its warehouse staff, which can automatically generate warnings and terminations without any human intervention. However, Amazon said the supervisors are able to override the process. Notably, Amazon has recently announced it plans to begin delivering packages on the same day of orders for Prime members.",Daily Mail,"If you're one of the  hundreds of thousands of employees working in an Amazon fulfillment center, technology many not only threatens to take your job, but could be the one pulling the trigger. A report from The Verge shows that Amazon uses a stringent set of metrics to not only track the performance of workers in its warehouses but to automatically terminate their employment if they fail to meet certain standards.In one facility located in Baltimore, the investigation found that approximately 300 full-time workers in one facility were fired for inefficiency between 2017 and 2018 -- a figure that represents 10 percent of the factory's overall workforce. Automation has been well-documented in its role of taking workers' jobs, but Amazon's systems are now putting computers in a position of authority. File photoAccording to documents obtained by The Verge, firings like those observed in Baltimore can take place without the involvement of a supervisor. Using a tool called 'time-off task' Amazon's systems can not only determine how long employees take between scanning packages or other duties, but it can also send automated warnings to workers and is authorized to terminate their employment if they under perform.While Amazon has long been known to use stringent metrics to track its employees performances, the report represents a new wrinkle which places computers in a position of authority over their role in the company.  Throughout the last several years, Amazon has come under fire for several issues relating to its treatment of workers that make up its fulfillment centers and warehouses. In January, workers announced that they will push to unionize citing harsh working conditions and standards.'We are not robots. We are human beings. We cannot come into work after only four hours of sleep and be expected to be fully energized and ready to work. That’s impossible,' said one worker in a statement following the announcement. Workers across the spectrum at Amazon have complained of onerous working conditions.

The Chinese brands grew 20% year-on-year (YoY) riding mainly on the growth of smartphones brands such as Vivo, Realme and OPPO. Vivo’s volume grew 119% whereas OPPO witnessed a growth of 28% YoY.Though India’s overall smartphone shipments grew 4% YoY, the report added.Talking about the reasons for the growth of Chinese brands, Tarun Pathak, Associate Director of Counterpoint said that data consumption is on the rise and users are upgrading their phones faster as compared to other regions. This has led to users spending more on their purchase which is driving up the overall average selling price (ASP) in the market.He expects these trends to continue in the future in the mid-tier segment.Xiaomi Redmi 6A remained the top model followed by Xiaomi Note 6 Pro, Redmi Y2, Samsung Galaxy M20, and Galaxy A50. Chinese brand aggressive offline expansion and a strong focus on product build helped to retain its top position in the Indian smartphone market.Earlier in February,  Xiaomi India Managing Director Manu Kumar Jain claimed that the Chinese smartphone maker is 54 per cent bigger than the second brand.However, Xiaomi faced fierce competition from non-Chinese brand Samsung, which had about 23% market share. In the premium segment, Samsung surpassed OnePlus to become the number one player driven by the good response for its newly introduced Galaxy S10 series.In the feature phone segment, Jio remained the leader, followed by Samsung, with about 30% market share.Lack of innovation and slow growth on part of Indian brands in the smartphone segment led to their lowest ever share.",https://entrackr.com/2019/04/chinese-smartphone-brands-capture-indian-market/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

From bowlers ‘Mankading’ non-striking batsman to some horrible goof-ups by umpires forcing a captain intruding the ground, this IPL has seen it many more. Opinions have remained divided over the incidents and now former international umpire Simon Taufel has come up with his take on the issues, particularly the one that involved Chennai Super Kings (CSK) captain MS Dhoni. In a tight game against Rajasthan Royals in Jaipur, an upset Dhoni entered the ground to challenge one of the umpires who had goofed up over a no-ball call.Taufel expressed surprise over Dhoni walking onto the field because the former India captain has always been known to be composed and capable of handling things in a measured manner. Taufel said non-participating players or coaches entering the field when play is on to approach an umpire is not right. He said the senior player’s acknowledging the same and pleading guilty to the charge imposed by the IPL officials proved the same. Dhoni was fined 50 per cent of his match fee because of the offence, which according to many, was not enough to curb a wrong precedent.Advertisement“I get that these are high-pressure moments – lots of things are riding on these games, a lot of money is involved, and there is a lot of excitement and passion within the ground and outside it. I do understand this environment, having had first-hand experience officiating in many IPL finals. But non-participating players or even coaches and managers entering the field of play to approach an umpire is not right.

He said it is important for the umpires to ensure that they didn’t let themselves surrounded by players and make decisions without sending an indication of getting influenced.The incident happened in the final over of the CSK’s chase when umpire Ulhas Gandhe signalled a delivery from Ben Stokes as no-ball after it went over the batsman’s waist but then did not follow it up, leaving the CSK players livid.",https://www.crictracker.com/umpires-should-have-turned-ms-dhoni-away-says-simon-taufel/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

20163,Dead may outnumber living Facebook users in 50 years: Oxford study,"If Facebook continues to expand at current rates, the number of deceased on the platform could reach as high as 4.9 billion before 2100, predict researchers from the Oxford Internet Institute. Based on 2018 user levels, at least 1.4 billion members will die before 2100 due to which the dead could outnumber the living by 2070, the study predicted.",Times Now,"London: If Facebook continues to expand at current rates, the number of deceased users could reach as high as 4.9 billion before the end of the century, making it the world's biggest graveyard, predict researchers from the University of Oxford. The dead may outnumber the living on Facebook within 50 years, a trend that will have grave implications for how we treat our digital heritage in the future, said researchers from the Oxford Internet Institute (OII), a part of the university.The analysis predicts that based on 2018 user levels, at least 1.4 billion members will die before 2100. In this scenario, the dead could outnumber the living by 2070. ""These statistics give rise to new and difficult questions around who has the right to all this data, how should it be managed in the best interests of the families and friends of the deceased and its use by future historians to understand the past,"" said lead author Carl Ohman, a doctoral candidate at the OII.The analysis sets up two potential extreme scenarios, arguing that the future trend will fall somewhere in between. The first scenario assumes that no new users join as of 2018. Under these conditions, Asia's share of dead users increases rapidly to account for nearly 44 per cent of the total by the end of the century.""Nearly half of those profiles come from India and Indonesia, which together account for just under 279 million Facebook mortalities by 2100,"" the researchers said. The second scenario assumes that Facebook continues to grow by its current rate of 13 per cent globally, every year, until each market reaches saturation.Under these conditions, Africa will make up a growing share of dead users. ""The management of our digital remains will eventually affect everyone who uses social media, since all of us will one day pass away and leave our data behind,"" said Ohman.The predictions are based on data from the United Nations, which provide the expected number of mortalities and total populations for every country in the world distributed by age, and Facebook data scraped from the company's Audience Insights feature.Facebook should invite historians, archivists, archaeologists and ethicists to participate in the process of curating the vast volume of accumulated data that we leave behind as we pass away.""This is not just about finding solutions that will be sustainable for the next couple of years, but possibly for many decades ahead,"" added study co-author David Watson, also a DPhil student at the OII.",https://www.timesnownews.com/technology-science/article/dead-to-outnumber-the-living-on-facebook-in-50-years/407978?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

20168,Donald Trump to withdraw US from Arms Trade Treaty,"US President Donald Trump has said he will withdraw the US from the international Arms Trade Treaty. The agreement, signed by former US President Barack Obama in 2013, aims to regulate the sale of weapons between countries. White House said the treaty ""fails to truly address the problem of irresponsible arms transfers"" because other top arms exporters haven't signed it.",Reuters,"INDIANAPOLIS (Reuters) - President Donald Trump told the National Rifle Association on Friday he was pulling the United States out of an international arms treaty signed in 2013 by then-President Barack Obama but opposed by the NRA and other conservative groups. Trump told members of the gun lobby at an annual meeting he intends to revoke the status of the United States as a signatory to the Arms Trade Treaty, which was never ratified by the U.S. Senate. “We’re taking our signature back,” Trump said to thousands of cheering attendees, many wearing red hats emblazoned with the Republican president’s “Make America Great Again” slogan. On Twitter, Trump called the decision a defense of “American sovereignty.” In reversing the U.S. position on the pact, he wrote, “We will never allow foreign bureaucrats to trample on your Second Amendment freedoms.” The NRA has long opposed the treaty, which regulates the $70 billion business in conventional arms and seeks to keep weapons out of the hands of human rights abusers. The lobbying group argues it would undermine domestic gun rights, a view the Obama administration rejected. The agreement covers weapons exports, ranging from small firearms to tanks, but not domestic sales. Trump said the United Nations would soon receive formal notice of the withdrawal. U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric called the treaty “a landmark achievement in the efforts to ensure responsibility in international arms transfers.” U.N. officials said they were unaware Trump had been planning to revoke the U.S. signature. The NRA spent $30.3 million in support of Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a group that tracks campaign spending. The 193-nation U.N. General Assembly overwhelmingly approved the pact in April 2013 and the United States, the world’s No. 1 arms exporter, voted in favor of it despite fierce opposition from the NRA. Dropping out of the treaty is part of a broader Trump administration overhaul of arms export policies to bolster a domestic industry that already dominates global weapons trade. Trump’s action drew an immediate rebuke from international human rights groups. “The United States will now lock arms with Iran, North Korea and Syria as non-signatories to this historic treaty whose sole purpose is to protect innocent people from deadly weapons,” said Oxfam America President Abby Maxman. So far 101 countries have formally joined onto the treaty. Another 29, including the United States, signed it, but have not yet formally joined. Ted Bromund, senior research fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said the treaty “can only have the perverse effects of driving potential importers to buy from China or Russia” and other nations that are not party to the agreement. Rachel Stohl, director of the conventional defense program at the Stimson Center think-tank in Washington, said U.S. firearms makers could benefit, including Smith & Wesson owner American Outdoor Brands Corp, Sturm Ruger and Vista Outdoor, as well as Remington Outdoor Co, which owns Bushmaster, a brand of AR-15 assault rifle. Trump was joined on his trip to the NRA’s meeting in  Indianapolis by White House national security adviser John Bolton, an advocate of withdrawing the United States from international treaties out of concern they might undermine U.S. authority. With Friday’s announcement, Trump continued his drive to roll back Obama-era initiatives. Nearly two years ago, Trump announced that the United States would withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement, which aims to reduce global carbon emissions that scientists link to harmful climate change. Republicans argue the U.S. economy would suffer if it met the deal’s carbon-reduction goals. In May, 2018, Trump pulled the United States out of a 2015 international deal that eased sanctions on Iran in exchange for strict limits being placed on Iran’s nuclear activities. The United States has since reimposed some sanctions that had been suspended under the deal. Friday’s speech marked the third consecutive year Trump has spoken to the annual meeting of the NRA. Since his election, he has been a vocal proponent of gun rights, a position that plays well with his political base. Trump banned “bump stocks” - rapid-fire gun attachments used in the October 2017 mass shooting that killed 58 people at a country music festival in Las Vegas. But he has sidestepped tough restrictions he considered after the February 2018 shooting at a high school in Parkland, Florida, in which 17 people were killed and embraced an NRA proposal for arming teachers to defend schools.

20181,"Ford facing criminal probe over emissions, unrelated to dieselgate","Ford revealed it is facing a criminal investigation by US authorities over its emissions certification process, after inconsistencies in emission test results were prompted by its staff. The automaker said the probe is unrelated to use of ""defeat devices"", which Volkswagen had used under its infamous 'Dieselgate' scandal to cheat investors. Ford said it's fully cooperating with the authorities.",Reuters,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department has opened a criminal investigation into Ford Motor Co’s emissions certification process in the United States, the automaker disclosed on Friday, saying it was cooperating fully with the probe and still conducting its own internal review. Ford said in a statement the Justice Department had notified it earlier this month of the criminal investigation, which made the automaker the latest to come under scrutiny for adherence to emissions standards by U.S. officials. “Ford is fully cooperating with the government, and we’ll keep them posted on what we’re finding through our investigation and technical review,” the company said. Justice Department spokesman Peter Carr declined to comment. The Environmental Protection Agency also declined comment. Ford has held meetings with the California Air Resources Board and EPA officials and turned over documents related to its review, a person briefed on the matter said. The No. 2 U.S. automaker has also submitted a testing plan that has been approved by regulators, the person said. The first vehicle Ford is evaluating is the 2019 Ranger pickup truck. Ford potentially faces significant financial penalties as regulators have taken a tough line on emissions issues. EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler said earlier this month the agency had other enforcement actions against other automakers “in the works.”  “When people are not playing by the rules and they are creating more pollution ... we will catch them, we will hold them accountable,” Wheeler said. Ford disclosed an issue with emissions to the EPA and the California in February, and hired outside law firm Sidley Austin and experts to investigate its vehicle fuel economy and testing procedures after employees raised concerns about analytical modeling that is part of its fuel economy and emissions compliance process. Ford said previously it did not know whether it would have to correct data provided to regulators or consumers. But the company reiterated in a regulatory filing Friday that the emissions issue does not involve the use of so-called defeat devices. (bit.ly/2VqjHpl) U.S. and California regulators have been cracking down on automakers for emissions cheating following revelations in 2015 that German automaker Volkswagen AG had used defeat devices to make models equipped with diesel engines appear to comply with emissions standards when they emitted far more pollution than allowed in real-world driving. Ford said it had been looking into concerns raised by employees since last fall that incorrect calculations were used to translate test results into vehicle mileage and emissions data submitted to regulators. Ford is evaluating changes to the process it uses to develop fuel economy and emissions figures “including engineering, technical and governance components,” the Dearborn, Michigan-based company said. In January, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV agreed to an $800 million settlement to resolve claims by the U.S. Justice Department and the state of California that it used illegal software to produce false results on diesel-emissions tests. A Justice Department criminal investigation is pending. U.S. regulators are also investigating Daimler AG for alleged excess emissions in Mercedes-Benz diesel vehicles, but the Justice Department and EPA have declined to comment on the status of the probe. Daimler has declined to comment, but has previously acknowledged it faces investigations in Germany and the United States. In total, Volkswagen has agreed to pay more than $25 billion in the United States over the diesel emissions scandal, for claims from owners, environmental regulators, states and dealers, and it offered to buy back about 500,000 polluting U.S. vehicles. Ford has been embarrassed in the past by errors in fuel economy claims. In 2013, the automaker cut by seven miles (11 km) per gallon the claimed fuel economy for its C-Max hybrid model following complaints that real-world mileage did not match the claimed fuel economy. In 2014, Ford lowered fuel economy ratings for six other models and offered compensation to customers.

On the other hand, you have Rahul baba, who goes for international vacations every two-three months leaving his party leaders, workers, and even his own mother worried,” he said while addressing a poll rally here. Upping the ante ahead of polls in the state, Shah claimed that Congress never gave a fitting reply to Pakistan during its tenure.“My heart still pains when I remember the cowardly attack when Pakistani soldiers mutilated the body of Hemraj (an Indian soldier) and disrespected him by kicking his decapitated head when Congress was in power. Yet, the UPA did nothing, Manmohan Singhji stayed silent as usual,” he claimed. In 2013, Lance Naik Hemraj was killed and his body was mutilated by Pakistan's Border Action Team (BAT) along the Line of Control (LoC). Meanwhile, Shah accused Congress of supporting separatists of the Kashmir valley, adding that its regional allies in Jharkhand (JMM, RJD) fared no better.“The Congress does not want us to remove Article 370 from Kashmir, Jharkhand Mukti Morcha and Rashtriya Janata Dal (regional allies of Congress in Jharkhand and Bihar) support the Congress on this issue. Our stand is clear but they are on the wrong side,” he said.“I have attended rallies and public meetings along the entire length and breadth of the country in the past four-five months and all I hear is Modi-Modi.

In those cases, Musk must seek pre-approval from a securities lawyer, according to the agreement filed with Manhattan federal court.U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan, the presiding judge on this matter, must still approve the deal.

20201,Dhoni's absence leaves holes to fill: CSK coach Fleming,"Speaking after Chennai Super Kings' loss against Mumbai Indians, CSK coach Stephen Fleming said that in CSK captain MS Dhoni's absence, there are going to be holes to fill. ""He is a great leader and a great player... He's been a constant for us for so many years that you get into the rhythm of having him there,"" Fleming added.",Times Now,"Chennai Super Kings (CSK) on Thursday suffered their fourth defeat in the ongoing Indian Premier League (IPL) 2019 as Mumbai Indians (MI) completed a double over the defending champions with a comprehensive 46-run win at Chepauk. CSK skipper MS Dhoni missed the clash due to fever as he chose not to travel to the stadium with Suresh Raina leading the side in his absence. His absence was largely felt as the hosts failed to chase down the target of 156 runs on a sluggish track after getting bundled out for a dismal 109. CSK head coach Stephen Fleming admitted that Dhoni's absence leaves big holes to be filled in the line-up which disrupts the team's rhythm as the veteran wicket-keeper batsman has been a talismanic figure in the team for years now and it takes a staggering effort to fill into his shoes. Dhoni has been instrumental in his side's success this season piling on runs consistently. He is the leading run-getter for his side so far with 314 runs in seven innings at an average of 104.66 and a strike rate close to 140.""He is a great leader and a great player. Whenever you take that out of the side (it's tough). He's been a constant for us for so many years that you get into the rhythm of having him there. When you take a leader like that out, there are going to be holes to fill,"" said Fleming talking about Dhoni's absence after CSK's loss at Chepauk.Dhoni was not match-fit to turn up against Mumbai Indians on Friday due to fever but the CSK skipper has also been battling a back problem this season and had earlier missed his side's clash against Sunrisers Hyderabad due to back spasm. The defending champions lost the game by 6 wickets with Dhoni's absence allowing SRH to exploit the loopholes in their middle-order. A similar scenario unfolded against Mumbai on Friday as the CSK middle order collapsed in the 156-run chase. The likes of Kedar Jadhav (6), Ambati Rayudu (0), Dhruv Shorey (5) and Dwayne Bravo (20) were all sent back cheaply leaving Mitchell Santner (22) with a lot to do as the Kiwi all-rounder also succumbed under pressure with Mumbai bowlers running riot at Chepauk.Fleming pointed out how Dhoni's absence on the pitch doesn't only affect the physical aspect of the game but also has a psychological impact on the player with the team's best player not playing. ""And it's not that we're not trying to fill it; it's just that the hole is so big. It takes a mammoth effort to lift the team up when you're having our best player unavailable. So, it's a psychological aspect as well,"" he said.CSK, despite the defeat, remain on top of the points table with 16 points from 12 games and will look to win their remaining two games to confirm their spot in top two. ",https://www.timesnownews.com/sports/cricket/article/ms-dhonis-absence-leaves-big-holes-to-fill-admits-stephen-fleming-after-csks-loss-to-mi/407874?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

It is reportedly offering shares at up to $28 apiece, giving it a valuation of nearly $17 billion. Slack has listed Microsoft as its ""primary competitor"", which had launched its own workplace chat platform Teams in 2017.",TechCrunch,"Slack  has filed to go public via a direct listing. Similar to what Spotify did last year, this means that the company won’t have a traditional IPO, and will instead allow existing shareholders to sell their stock to investors.The company’s S-1 filing says it plans to make $100 million worth of shares available, but that’s probably a placeholder figure.The S-1 offers data about the company’s financial performance, reporting a net loss of $138.9 million and revenue of $400.6 million in the fiscal year ending January 31, 2019. That’s compared to a loss of $140.1 million on revenue of $220.5 million for the year before.The company attributes these losses to its decision “to invest in growing our business to capitalize on our market opportunity,” and notes that they’re shrinking as a percentage of revenue.Slack also says that in the three months ending on January 31, it had more than 10 million daily active users across more than 600,000 organizations — 88,000 on the paid plan and 550,000 on the free plan.In the filing, the company says the Slack team created the product to meet its own collaboration needs.“Since our public launch in 2014, it has become apparent that organizations worldwide have similar needs, and are now finding the solution with Slack,” it says. “Our growth is largely due to word-of-mouth recommendations. Slack usage inside organizations of all kinds is typically initially driven bottoms-up, by end users. Despite this, we (and the rest of the world) still have a hard time explaining Slack. It’s been called an operating system for teams, a hub for collaboration, a connective tissue across the organization, and much else. Fundamentally, it is a new layer of the business technology stack in a category that is still being defined.”The company suggests that the total market opportunity for Slack and other makers of workplace collaboration software is $28 billion, and it plans to grow through strategies like expanding its footprint within organizations already using Slack, investing in more enterprise features, expanding internationally and growing the developer ecosystem.The risk factors mentioned in the filing sound pretty boilerplate and/or similar to other internet companies going public, like the aforementioned net losses and the fact that its current growth rate might not be sustainable, as well as new compliance risks under Europe’s GDPR.Slack has previously raised a total of $1.2 billion in funding, according to Crunchbase, from investors including Accel, Andreessen Horowitz, Social Capital, SoftBank, Google Ventures and Kleiner Perkins.",https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/26/slack-files-to-go-public/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

Even after her elaborate wedding celebrations, Deepika continued to opt for Sabyasachi creations for her various public appearances, including the ones at the airport. When the ace couturier was asked about Deepika in a recent interview with iDiva, he revealed that she scares him. Detailing as to why, Sabyasachi told the portal, “She scares me. Deepika scares me because of the fact that I think she is so organised that you know, I pride myself in being organised, but she is so meticulous, organised and so composed about everything that she does that I look like a rookie.”Asked about the intimate Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh's wedding at Lake Como in Italy, Sabyasachi revealed that it was a lot of fun. As for Ranveer, he said, “With Ranveer, there's no choice but to have fun. He just makes sure that you participate.”In case you missed out, here are all the times Deepika sported Sabyasachi ensembles during her wedding festivities and after:

Bhogle said Riyan was caught by MS Dhoni on his IPL debut on April 11, while then 18-year-old Dhoni, during his debut Ranji season for Bihar in 2000, had stumped Das, who opened for Assam.",CricTracker,"A die-hard fan may know that MS Dhoni had made his first-class debut for Bihar Ranji Team way back in 1999-2000. That’s 20 years ago and during this time, Dhoni has shared the field with numerous national and international cricketers. It is highly possible that Dhoni might have played with a pair of the father-son duo, something that recently came to light.MS Dhoni’s Chennai Super Kings is doing wonders in the ongoing IPL 2019 with 8 wins in 11 matches and holding the top spot in the points table. Recently, CSK faced Rajasthan Royals at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium in Jaipur, in which the visiting team defeated the home team and Dhoni had dismissed a 17-year-old Riyan Parag.AdvertisementHowever, here is when things get interesting and Harsha Bhogle, the ace commentator unveiled connecting Parag and Dhoni.As bizarre as it sounds, Dhoni’s career has spanned so long that he has managed to dismiss a father-son duo on top-flight cricket. Going back to roughly about 19 years, when Dhoni had just made it into the Bihar Ranji side, they faced off against Assam in an East Zone fixture which featured Riyan’s father Parag Das, who opened the innings.The wicketkeeper-batsman brought an end to Das’ innings by stumping him out after he had made 30 runs from 24 balls. This means that Dhoni might be one of the few wicketkeepers to dismiss both father and son in senior cricket.Someone on twitter (sorry there were lots of msgs and I can't trace the name) pointed out this interesting bit of trivia. #RR played #CSK on April 11 in Jaipur and Riyan Parag was caught by MS Dhoni for 16.— Harsha Bhogle (@bhogleharsha) April 26, 2019Many years ago, in the 99-00 season of the Ranji Trophy (see the 2nd innings of Assam in this scorecard) https://t.co/R2CzlZvnwGAn Assam opener, called Parag Das was stumped by a young keeper called MS Dhoni.

20226,"6 kids, 3 women among 15 killed in raid on terror hideout in SL","The Sri Lankan authorities have said six kids and three women were among 15 killed in a raid on a terror hideout in the country on Friday. A police spokesman said that three suspected suicide bombers were among those killed. Meanwhile, police have detained at least 76 people, including foreigners, in their investigations over the serial bomb blasts.",Reuters,"COLOMBO (Reuters) - Sri Lanka’s president on Saturday outlawed two Islamist groups suspected to be behind the suicide bombings on churches and hotels while the wife and child of the suspected ringleader were wounded during a military raid in safe house, his family and police said.  The National Thawheedh Jamaath (NTJ) and Jamathei Millathu Ibrahim were banned under his emergency powers, President Maithripala Sirisena said in a statement, nearly a week after the Easter Sunday attacks that killed more than 250 people. Authorities could not act earlier to ban the two little known groups because the law required them to show firm evidence against them, officials said. Police believe the suspected mastermind of the bombings, Mohamed Hashim Mohamed Zahran, led either the NTJ or a splinter group. Less is known about Jamathei Millathu Ibrahim, whose members are also believed to have played a role in the bombings. Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the attacks. Nearly 10,000 soldiers have been deployed across the island to carry out searches and boost security since the bombings in three churches and four hotels, most of which were in the capital Colombo. Security forces have detained 100 people, including foreigners from Syria and Egypt, police said. A gunbattle erupted on Friday evening during a raid on a safe house in Sainthamaruthu in Ampara district on the island’s east coast, killing at least 15 people including three people with suicide vests and six children, a military spokesman said. The wounded included the wife and a daughter of Zahran, his family said. “Yes, the wife and daughter were injured in the attack,” said Mohamed Hashim Mathaniya, sister of Zahran. “I was asked to come to identify them but I am not sure I can go,” she told Reuters from the town of Kattankudy in the east where Zahran was originally based. Zahran’s driver was detained in a separate raid, according to a police statement. Bomb-making materials, dozens of gelignite sticks and thousands of ball bearings were found in a search of a separate house in the same area, along with Islamic State banners and uniforms, the military said. Zahran appeared in a video released by Islamic State days after the bombing, the only one showing his face while seven others were covered. In the video the men stand under a black Islamic State flag and declare their loyalty to its leader, Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi.   Authorities have said there could be more attacks against religious centers. Last Sunday’s bombings shattered the relative calm that the Buddhist-majority country has seen since a 26-year civil war with mostly-Hindu ethnic Tamil separatists ended a decade ago. Sirisena and the government of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe have faced strong criticism after it emerged that India had repeatedly given warnings of the possibility of attacks. Both Sirisena and Wickremesinghe have said intelligence was not shared with them, exposing rifts at the top of the government and raising questions about its ability to deal with the security crisis. The national police chief had refused to accept Sirisena’s request to step down, two sources told Reuters on Saturday, a further embarrassment for the president.  The U.S. State Department said terrorist groups were continuing to plot attacks and cautioned its citizens against traveling to Sri Lanka, as well as ordering the departure of all school-age family members of U.S. government employees. India and Britain have also warned their nationals to avoid traveling to Sri Lanka. The security forces’ response has included raids on mosques and homes of people in the town of Negombo where scores died in the bombing of a church. Police said on Friday they were trying to track down 140 people they believe have links with Islamic State. India and Britain have also warned their nationals to avoid traveling to Sri Lanka. The security forces’ response has included raids on mosques and homes of people in the town of Negombo where scores died in the bombing of a church. Police said on Friday they were trying to track down 140 people they believe have links with Islamic State. The president said some of the country’s youth had been involved with the group since 2013 and that there were drug trafficking links. Muslims were urged to pray at home on Friday after the State Intelligence Services warned of possible car bomb attacks, amid fears of retaliatory violence. Many have fled their homes amid bomb scares, lockdowns and security sweeps.        The archbishop of Colombo, Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith, told reporters he had seen an internal security document warning of further attacks on churches and said there would be no Catholic masses celebrated anywhere on the island this Sunday. Sri Lanka’s 22 million people include minority Christians, Muslims and Hindus. Until now, Christians had largely managed to avoid the worst of the island’s conflict and communal tensions.

We have many leaders who are capable and it will be improper to name anyone now.”“We will have magic numbers with everyone’s support. So our policy while forming the government will be on creating a common minimum programme,” said the senior leader while adding that the need of the hour is to collaborate since regional parties cannot script success beyond their stronghold.“DMK will never yield results in UP. The same is applicable to Akhilesh’s Samajwadi party. Hence all of us have decided that we will cooperate with each other.

Only the county director is notified in this case. The second violation, which Alex Hales has done, leads to a three-week ban and five percent fine of the player’s annual salary.

20251,Thoughts of WC selection might've impacted PantÂ’s form: Ponting,"Speaking about players' form in the IPL 2019, Delhi Capitals' coach Ricky Ponting said, ""Players like Rishabh might have had certain thoughts about World Cup selection... I'm glad he found form again against RR."" ""[W]hat you want from players like him [Pant]... is that they win you three or four matches each throughout the season,"" Ponting further said.",Times Now,"Delhi Capitals’ (DC) head coach Ricky Ponting feels the World Cup 2019 selection might have played a part in Rishabh Pant’s inconsistent first half for the franchise in the ongoing Indian Premier League (IPL) 2019. Pant, who was overlooked for the 15-man World Cup squad for Dinesh Karthik, has been going through a hot and cold IPL 2019 and has scored just 336 runs in 11 matches at an average of 37.33. Pant has been central to criticism as he has been blamed for throwing his wicket away after getting a good start. But it looks like the left-handed batter has started to take up the responsibility after he played an unbeaten knock of 78 runs off 36 balls to take DC over the winning line against Rajasthan Royals (RR) on Monday (April 22).The flamboyant wicketkeeper-batsman has scored just two half-centuries in the ongoing cash-rich league and Ponting feels what a team wants from players like Pant is that they win three or four matches in a season. Pant has already won two matches for DC single-handedly, one against Mumbai Indians (MI) in match number three of IPL 2019, the other one against RR in match number 40. Ponting feels that if Pant can stay in good touch in the remainder of the IPL 2019 then he can bag a couple of more wins for the team.   “There have been questions asked about where we should have dropped certain players in some matches, but I believe when you have talented players in your squad, you just keep backing them. We have players who can turn it around quite quickly as it takes just one inning or a match to get going in a tournament like this,” the 44-year-old Australian legend said as quoted by PTI.“Players like Rishabh might have had certain thoughts about World Cup selection, but to be honest, that 78 not out in the first match against Mumbai got us the win. I’m glad he found form again against RR, and what you want from players like him in such a tournament is that they win you three or four matches each throughout the season, and he has won two games for us so far, and if he remains in form, he can get a couple of more wins,” the three-time World Cup winner added.Meanwhile, DC have been in astonishing form this season and have racked up 14 points in 11 matches. They currently sit second in the points table and are almost certain of a playoff spot.DC will next face Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) on Sunday (April 28) as the Shreyas Iyer-led outfit continues its hunt for the maiden IPL trophy.",https://www.timesnownews.com/sports/cricket/article/thoughts-of-world-cup-2019-selection-might-have-impacted-rishabh-pant-s-form-reckons-ricky-ponting/407546?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

The company will be investigated under the European GDPR data protection law, which could lead to fines of up to four percent of its global annual revenue for the infringing year — already some several billions of dollars.Then, Canadian authorities confirmed that the beleaguered social networking giant broke its strict privacy laws, reports TechCrunch’s Natasha Lomas. The Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada said it plans to take Facebook to federal court to force the company to correct its “serious contraventions” of Canadian privacy law. The findings came in the aftermath of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, which vacuumed up more than 600,000 profiles of Canadian citizens.Lastly, and slightly closer to home, Facebook was hit by its third investigation — this time by New York attorney general Letitia James. The state chief law enforcer is looking into the recent “unauthorized collection” of 1.5 million user email addresses, which Facebook used for profile verification, but inadvertently also scraped their contact lists.“It is time Facebook is held accountable for how it handles consumers’ personal information,” said James in a statement. “Facebook has repeatedly demonstrated a lack of respect for consumers’ information while at the same time profiting from mining that data.”Facebook spokesperson Jay Nancarrow said the company is “in touch with the New York State attorney general’s office and are responding to their questions on this matter.”You might think a trifecta of terrible news would be crushing for the social network. Alas, its stock is up close to 6 percent at market close, adding some $40 billion to its value.Mark Zuckerberg is ‘proud’ of how Facebook handled its scandals this year",https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/25/facebook-privacy-investigations/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

20260,Russian spy jailed for 18 months for conspiring against US,Russian spy Maria Butina who had pleaded guilty to a conspiracy to act as a Russian government agent has been sentenced to 18 months in prison by a US court. Butina had tried to infiltrate the National Rifle Association in an effort to influence American policies in favour of Russia. She will be deported to Russia after serving her sentence.,RT,"Before the sentencing hearing on Friday, Butina asked the judge for leniency.“My parents discovered my arrest on the morning news they watch in their rural house in a Siberian village,” she told the court. “I love them dearly, but I harmed them morally and financially. They are suffering from all of that. I destroyed my own life as well. I came to the United States not under any orders, but with hope, and now nothing remains but penitence.”Butina traveled to the US on a student visa in 2016 and became active in pro-gun circles. Swept up in the hunt for “Russian agents” in the wake of President Donald Trump’s election, she was accused of working with the Russian government to make inroads with the Republican Party and National Rifle Association. Moscow has rubbished the notion of having any connection to her.Butina pleaded guilty to felony charges of conspiracy to act as an unregistered foreign agent in the US, a requirement she said she was unaware of.Her nine months already served in prison will count towards her 18 month sentence. During her time in jail, Butina alleged she was treated unnecessarily harshly, with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov saying her conditions were “normally reserved for dangerous repeat offenders.”Since her arrest in July of last year, much of the mainstream media ran story after story alleging Butina was a spy who sought to ingratiate herself into the US establishment, and even offered sex in exchange for influence. Her lawyer, Robert Driscoll, told reporters on Friday that Butina was arrested and smeared for no other reason than her nationality.“Anyone who thinks that someone who wasn’t Russian would be in this situation is fooling themselves,” he said.Butina’s sentencing brings to a close another ‘Russiagate’ feeding frenzy that has dragged on alongside Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation. Though Butina pleaded guilty, her defence team maintains that she was not a spy, “never engaged in covert activity and she has never lied to our government.” Think your friends would be interested?

""It's the toughest test...but I'll face it head on and tackle it,"" the 50-year-old said. ""I found out six weeks ago...it's a bit of a shock but there's always someone else worse off...you've to cope with it,"" he added.",CricTracker,"The former England cricketer Shaun Udal is going through the worst phase of his life at the moment. He was diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease in January this year is a condition in which the parts of the human’s brain get progressively damaged over the years. Its three main symptoms are involuntary shaking, slow movement and stiff and inflexible muscles.Shaun confirmed the disease on his social media account recently and is overwhelmed with the support he has been getting from everyone. He is also ready to go through the sternest test of his life and is looking at it in a positive way. Udal, who played four Tests and 11 ODIs for England, admitted to being shocked after knowing about the disease but feels that he has cope with it now and move on.Advertisement“I found out six weeks ago, it’s a bit of a shock but there’s always someone else worse off and you have to cope with it and move on. I’ve just got to get on with it. I can’t think negatively and get downbeat because it’s going to affect my chances of recovery and progress. It’s the toughest test, but I’ll face it head on, tackle it and with the support of friends and family we’ll keep it under control,” Shaun said while speaking to BBC Radio Solent.Ever since Shaun Udal has made the public aware of being diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease, he has been receiving a lot of support on social media. Though a few of them have questioned this approach, the 50-year-old feels it might help people with awareness and there was nothing to hide.Moreover, his former team-mates have called Shaun up which include the likes of Michael Clarke, Kevin Pietersen, Darren Gough and Liam Dawson. “It’s been great. Some people said ‘why put it on Twitter?’ But I was getting lots of calls and questions asking if it’s true and I thought ‘I’ve got nothing to hide’ and it might help with the awareness.“Michael Clarke has been in touch from Australia, people from South Africa, Kevin Pietersen, Darren Gough, some of the Hampshire boys like [Liam] Dawson. It’s nice to get a reaction you’d hope you get but there are also some alternative people from the medicine world that have been in touch, if I need help, second opinion, drugs and stuff to make contact,” Shaun further added.",https://www.crictracker.com/former-england-cricketer-shaun-udal-diagnosed-with-parkinsons-disease/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

20275,Ex-US police officer jailed for 25yrs for shooting black man dead,An Indian-American former police officer in the US was sentenced to 25 years in prison on Thursday for shooting to death a black motorist who was waiting for a tow truck in October 2015. Nouman Raja was fired after he killed Corey Jones while on plainclothes duty. The 41-year-old was convicted last month of manslaughter and first-degree murder.,Reuters,"(Reuters) - A former Florida police officer was sentenced to 25 years in prison on Thursday for fatally shooting a black motorist who was awaiting a tow truck in October 2015. Nouman Raja, 41, was fired from the Palm Beach Gardens Police Department shortly after he killed Corey Jones, 31, while on plainclothes duty, and was convicted last month by a jury of manslaughter and first-degree murder. The conviction was unusual in a country in which police officers kill roughly 1,000 people each year, a disproportionate number of them black men, usually without facing prosecution, according to a Washington Post database on police shootings. Jones’ relatives asked Judge Joseph Marx to give Raja the maximum sentence of life in prison during the sentencing hearing. The judge said it was a “heartbreaking” case before handing down the sentence of 25 years, the minimum required under state law, for both counts, to run concurrently. Police said Raja was in plainclothes and driving an unmarked van when he encountered a car he thought was abandoned on a West Palm Beach highway exit ramp on Oct. 18, 2015, a few hours before sunrise.  Jones was in the car, waiting for a tow truck. Prosecutors said Raja never identified himself as a police officer and that the officer acted aggressively in a way that likely led Jones to mistake him for a robber. Police said Jones pulled out a handgun that he had legally purchased three days earlier before Raja fired at him six times within 13 seconds. Raja hit Jones three times and Jones died of a gunshot wound to his chest. Raja’s defense team has argued that their client feared for his life when Jones drew his gun.  Jones’ relatives read statements describing Jones, a professional drummer, as a religious man and dedicated musician. Raja’s wife and other relatives pleaded for leniency for what they said was a bad decision in a difficult moment doing a dangerous job. His lawyers condemned the notion that Raja, as a Muslim man of Asian descent, was motivated by racial prejudice. Sheila Banks, Jones’ godmother and aunt, called Jones a “gentle soul,” and choked back tears as she pictured his dying moments. “No one was there to hold his hand, to comfort him, to save his life,” she told the court. “The person we trusted to serve and protect did not.” Raja appeared in prison overalls, his head bowed and his hands clasped during testimony from both his relatives and the victim’s. His lip trembled with emotion as his wife described how he had sent three letters a day from prison, one each for her and their two children. Raja’s elder brother, who continues to work as a police officer, apologized to the Jones family and complained that Raja had been unfairly treated for what he called “a bad decision.”  “Yes, it has something to do with race,” Anand Raja told the court. “As proud American Muslims, we’re not light enough, we’re not dark enough.” Raja’s lawyers have appealed to have the conviction overturned. In a news conference after the sentencing, Benjamin Crump, a prominent civil rights attorney who represented Jones’ family, listed a string of high-profile shootings of black men by police in recent years in which officers were not charged. “Today we can tell many of those families that there’s hope for America,” Crump said, “because a jury in Palm Beach, Florida, looked at all the evidence and said a black man killed by the police can get equal justice.” Reporting by Gabriella Borter and Jonathan Allen in New York; editing by David Gregorio and Bill Trott",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-florida-shooting-idUSKCN1S11UI?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=5cc26c1d341f8f00018ce1ba&utm_source=inshorts

The crash also started a fire which engulfed three trucks and 12 cars. The driver of the tractor-trailer who sustained minor injuries is being charged with multiple counts of vehicular homicide.",Reuters,"DENVER (Reuters) - Multiple people were killed and many others injured in a fiery multi-vehicle crash west of Denver during the evening commute on Thursday when a tractor-trailer careened out of the control into several other vehicles, police said.  Flames ignited by the crash on Interstate 70 engulfed three trucks and 12 cars, Ty Countryman, a spokesman for the police department in Lakewood, Colorado, told reporters. “The vehicle came down and ended up colliding with slower traffic, causing a very big chain-reaction crash that also ignited and started a fire,” Countryman said, adding that six other people injured in the crash were taken to local hospitals. Police did not say how many people died, but in a late night Twitter post, they said, “Our crash investigation on I-70 continues. We can now confirm multiple fatalities.” Video footage of the accident’s aftermath showed flames raging beneath and around a highway overpass and a pall of black smoke in the air over the scene. A stretch of Interstate 70, a major east-west highway route that runs through Denver into the mountains, was closed in both directions. Police said late Thursday that the highway would remain closed overnight. Countryman said engineers from the state Transportation Department were inspecting the overpass bridge for possible structural damage from the fire. Investigators are looking at whether the truck lost its cargo, experienced brake failure or had some other mechanical issue, he said. It was not immediately clear which vehicle accounted for the fatality, he said.

During four days of interrogation, Apoorva did not break down once, an officer said. Apoorva claimed that Rohit's mother interfered in their marriage and affected their relationship, he added.",India.com,"New Deli: Apoorva, the lawyer wife of Rohit Shekhar Tiwari who has been arrested for allegedly killing him, has shown confusing behaviour, a police officer, adding she regrets her action sometimes and appears cold about the incident other times.During four days of intense interrogation, she did not break down once but now she appears to be regretting smothering Tiwari on the night of April 15-16. She also claimed that Tiwari’s mother, Ujjwala, often interfered between them and this affected the couple’s relationship, the officer said.On the night Tiwari was killed, he and Apoorva were in their room at the Defence Colony residence when they had a fight over Tiwari’s proximity with his sister-in-law. “She told him she did not like his proximity with his sister-in-law and that he used to drink with her. He teased her saying that when he was returning from Uttarakhand, he and his sister-in-law drank alcohol from the same glass. This angered Apoorva. She held on to his neck and when he tried to raise an alarm, she choked him with a pillow,” the officer said.Police sources, meanwhile, claimed a letter, written by the District Bar Association of Indore on April 22, was received by the Crime Branch. It sought a fair probe in the case and urged the police department to ensure that Apoorva is not implicated, they said. The letter also indicated that Apoorva may have been framed since Tiwari’s family did not want her to get any share in his property.But the family has claimed the letter was written at the behest of Apoorva’s father, who is a well-known lawyer in Indore and served at a top post in the bar association, the sources said.Police have sought call details of the landline number at Tiwari’s Defence Colony residence. They have also taken Apoorva’s nail samples to ascertain if Tiwari’s skin was stuck in them during the fight, or to see the possibility of any other DNA present there. But, the sources said, there may not be any clue as the samples were taken a few days after the killing.The south district police, which investigated the case previously, did seal the room on April 16 after Tiwari was declared brought dead at a city hospital.Initially, it was suspected that he had died of natural causes but after an autopsy, it was found he was “smothered” with a pillow.Police said she did enter the room a couple of times after allegedly killing him at around 1 am, so there are high possibilities of the crime scene being contaminated.“She must have tried to tamper with the bedsheet and the pillows and tried to dress up the room to destroy the evidence,” the police officer said.According to him, Apoorva strangulated Tiwari with bare hands and then used the pillow, so that he could not shout for help. She managed to keep his death a secret for almost 14 hours.On Wednesday, Apoorva was taken to the Defence Colony residence where police recreated the crime scene.Tiwari’s family members suspect he was allegedly drugged by Apoorva before being killed. Only the viscera report will confirm if he was drugged, the officer said.Bedsheets, pillows, Tiwari’s clothes have been sent for forensic examination.Police said Tiwari was short-tempered and the couple often fought over trivial issues since their marriage about a year ago.The police officer ruled out any possibility of psychological examination of Apoorva.",https://www.india.com/news/india/apoorva-regrets-killing-husband-rohit-tiwari-sometimes-and-then-acts-cold-cops-say-accused-is-confused-3641855/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

Rajnath further said that in the coming days insurgency will be completely finished in Northeast.",The Financial Express,"Curbing insurgency in the Northeast has been his biggest achievement as home minister, according to Rajnath Singh who says Naxal violence in the country is also on the wane. The Union home minister asserts that BJP will come back to power with a thumping majority as people want the good governance of the Narendra Modi dispensation to continue.“The way Modiji has led the country at national and international levels in the last five years, there is not an iota of doubt about our win with three-fourths majority in these polls,” he claims.Singh says as home minister, he worked, among other things, towards curbing insurgency in the Northeast and Naxalism in parts of the country. “Insurgency in Northeast is almost finished. We are now in the most favourable position since 1971, when more security personnel used to get killed than Naxals. Now the trend has reversed… Our security forces have been giving a befitting reply and eliminating Naxals,” he told PTI in an interview.Earlier Naxals operated in 126 districts, but now their activities are limited to just six-seven districts, he says. “We are quite sure that in coming days, we will root them out. The elimination of insurgency in the Northeast has been my biggest achievement as home minister…even beyond my expectations,” the former chief minister of Uttar Pradesh says.He also says that as home minister, he made maximum number of visits to Jammu and Kashmir and tried to find a long-term solution to the region’s problems, though it could not yield the desired results.“Now, time has come to review articles 35A and 370 of the Constitution (providing special status and rights to the state and its citizens) and assess what Jammu and Kashmir got and what it lost due to these two provisions,” he says.“My ministry also revoked the registration of 20,000 organisations which used to get money from overseas, under the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act, and were involved in activities which were not in the interest of our country,” he says.Singh says he does not believe that Modi’s persona is overshadowing the work of other lawmakers and ministers. “Whatever ministers or MPs do, they do it after getting the team leader’s consent, it is but natural. All policy decisions are taken under the chairmanship of the prime minister. So, saying that the work of other ministers or MPs is overshadowed is not right,” he says.“People are smart enough and politically aware. They have their own parameters to gauge public representatives’ records and performances,” he adds.To a query why the BJP’s campaign has no mention of demonetisation and GST, Singh, who headed the party’s manifesto committee, says they are no longer poll issues.“Their (positive and expected) results have started surfacing. GST has been simplified several times and we have made it abundantly clear that whenever there is a need, we will come up with more simplifications so that the business class does not suffer,” he says.Asked why the BJP has ‘imported’ candidates from outside the party, like Bhojpuri film actors Nirahua and Ravi Kishan, Bollywood star Sunny Deol and Pragya Thakur, he says it shows the party’s “inclusive and pluralistic” character.“Let me clarify that the BJP’s core cadre is quite strong and we have no dearth of candidates. But there are some people in every society who have a large fan following and have some intrinsic political acumen. “When we get these people in our party, they become an integral part of the BJP family and by this way, our party becomes more inclusive and pluralistic,” he reasons.Asked about the BJP fielded only a few Muslim candidates, he says though he was not in a position to tell the exact number, but the party has given tickets to members from the community. “We are very careful about our core principal – ‘Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas’. Unfortunately, the opposition parties are unsuccessfully trying to create a fear factor. But we have built a sense of confidence and I am quite sure that we will get their (Muslims) bigger support this time than what we got in the previous Lok Sabha election,” he claims.Singh says North Indians living in Maharashtra always supported the BJP ever since this party came to existence.He also dubs the BJP-Shiv Sena alliance as an “unbreakable bond”.“The coming together of two parties with same nationalist ideology is very rare. But this is possible only here in Maharashtra. Though we had some differences, but they have been resolved. The BJP-Shiv Sena have an unbreakable bond and we have proved it,” he adds.Get live Stock Prices from BSE and NSE and latest NAV, portfolio of Mutual Funds, calculate your tax by Income Tax Calculator, know market’s Top Gainers, Top Losers & Best Equity Funds.

If Thakur respects hijab then she must apologise to the Muslim community and then I will surely campaign for her,"" Siddique said while speaking to ANI. Last week, Thakur had said that she is ""proud"" to accept that she was involved in the demolition of the Babri Masjid in Ayodhya on December 6, 1992.Expressing discontentment over the controversial statements delivered by Thakur, Siddique said: ""What Thakur has said was obnoxious and communal and her views can tarnish the image of the party.

Be loyal to the country you are part of, we support the idea of Hindustan Zindabad. But what will happen to such talks, are they about development? Will they bring employment, education, women empowerment etc?""""Nowadays, people have become wiser, they are not in favour of dividing Hindu and Muslims.

It was great to see Watson's innings the other day, it has been coming. We have been watching these guys closely in the nets and Watson in particular has been hitting the ball well. We knew there was a big score coming and let us hope he can have that consistency in the back end of the tournament,"" he said.""I was really proud of the way MS (Dhoni) and (Stephen) Fleming showed faith in him (Watson), kept believing in the way he can play and he can win matches for CSK.

However, it said that ""we can't promise any selfies from secret locations"".",Engadget,"The CIA launched its Instagram account on Thursday afternoon in a bid for transparency that will probably only reveal how thirsty it is for likes. Sure enough, America's top spy agency's debut post on Instagram is an obviously staged shot of a fake CIA employee's desk; complete with props that would be more at home in Harriet the Spy than Zero Dark Thirty. There is a wig disguise and a paper bag labeled ""Top Secret Pulp"". The caption is ""I spy with my little eye..."".Staged shots? Cheesy out-of-context quotes and props? Possible haircare sponcon? To the credit of America's clandestine services, it obviously understands what Instagram is all about. According to CNET, the post also includes a few Easter eggs for CIA nerds, such as CIA Director Gina Haspel's original agency badge and a notebook with the agency's motto, ""Share what we can, protect what we must,"" in Arabic.Why do the folks at Langley want an Instagram presence? Haspel said last week that the CIA would launch an Instagram account in an effort to increase transparency. Unfortunately, Instagram's world of filtered ""I woke up like this"" selfies, influencers posing with sponsored products in exotic locales and celebrities posting staged Instagram stories probably isn't the best place to do it.Instagram is for making other people jealous, as federal agencies like NASA, NOAA, and the Department of Defense have quickly learned. NASA's Instagram account has over 41 million followers; it will regularly post jaw-dropping shots of planets, constellations, and rockets that will garner over a million likes. The DoD has paratroopers. NOAA has baby seals and closeups of sea creatures that look like they came out of Alien. It remains to be seen what the CIA will bring to the cutthroat world of federal government Instagram accounts, but let's hope for its growing number of followers (roughly 3,000 and counting) that it's something good.",https://www.engadget.com/2019/04/25/the-cia-is-now-on-instagram/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

Once a marketing, product or entertainment video has been shot, it’s very difficult to quickly and affordably edit the creative or translate into different languages.As co-founder Victor Riparbelli Rasmussen tells me: “We believe generating semi or fully artificial video is more efficient. This digital creation process is already the industry standard with images through applications like PhotoShop. We’re enabling the same for video.”Synthesia  says it can reduce the need to go on set to produce video content. Rather than shooting a new video, it can edit existing assets to create derivative international and personalized videos.Rasmussen says: “Our solution allows companies to 10x their video output for a tenth of the costs of conventional production. A simple interview-style video can easily involve many people and extensive production costs across the organization. With our solution, a marketing manager at an advertising agency, a Fortune 1000 company or small business can create a new video from behind her screen and have it delivered back within 48 hours.”The U.K.-based startup has now raised $3.1 million, with the financing led by LDV Capital,  early investor Mark Cuban  and new investors MMC Ventures,  Seedcamp,  Martin Varsavsky’s VAS Ventures, TransferWise  co-founder Taavet Hinrikus,  Tiny VC and advertising executive Nigel Morris.“Video production is exponentially increasing but it is extremely challenging to internationalize and easily personalize advertising, marketing and e-learning videos across cultures,” says Evan Nisselson,  general partner at LDV Capital. “Synthesia is leveraging computer vision and artificial intelligence to revolutionize video production for brands and creators.”Synthesia was founded by a team of researchers and entrepreneurs from UCL, Stanford, TUM and Foundry. Notably, Prof. Matthias Niessner, one of the co-founders of the company, is behind some of the most well-recognized research projects in the field Deep Video Portraits and Face2Face.The London-based startup came out of stealth in November 2018, airing their first public demo with the BBC, showcasing Synthesia technology by enabling newsreader Matthew Amroliwala to speak three different languages.Their customers already include global brands such as Accenture,  McCann Worldgroup, the Dallas Mavericks and Axiata Group.But what about deep fakes and the potential for disinformation?Synthesia says it has strong ethical guidelines and aims to ensure that all the content created is consensual and that actors are in control of their likeness.So this is not software that you can just download from the web and apply to Bernie Sanders’ face.Rasmussen says the company is actively working with governments and media organizations to create public awareness and develop technological security mechanisms to ensure that society gets to harness the benefits and reduce potential negative effects from synthetic media technologies.Well, let’s hope so…",https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/25/the-startup-behind-that-deep-fake-david-beckham-video-just-raised-3m/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

In a statement sent to Reuters on Thursday, JBS said Seara became the first company in Brazil authorized by India to sell chicken products in the Asian nation. India’s per capita chicken consumption is forecast to increase to 2.23 kilos in 2019, up from 2.18 kilos in the previous year, as personal income rise, according data from the United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organization.  JBS’s first shipment of chicken thighs and leg quarters to India is scheduled for the next few weeks, the company said, declining to disclose the volumes involved for strategic reasons. The first consignment will arrive at the port of Jawaharlal Nehru, and the distribution to be made by an unnamed local firm, the statement added. Poultry is likely to become the most consumed meat protein globally in 2019, as an outbreak of African swine fever in China is reshaping the international meat landscape, according to U.S. based International Poultry Council.  As a result of the spread of the disease, which is deadly for hogs but not for humans, the world will be unable to fill the supply gap in meat proteins, Christine McCracken, senior protein analyst at Rabobank, was quoted as saying in a statement from the IPC. As a result, prices for all types of meats will rise, she said.

But if you make it, I will see you at the Starting Gate!Although long considered a frontrunner, Biden only formally declared his presidential bid earlier on Thursday. In a video address, Biden made Trump the focus of his campaign, linking the president with white supremacist protesters, and referring to ‘Antifa’ activists as “a courageous group of Americans.”The core values of this nation… our standing in the world… our very democracy...everything that has made America -- America --is at stake.

Instead it exclusively highlights his opposition to Trump. However, the former vice president is an establishment Democrat in the mold of Hillary Clinton, rather than a more left-leaning activist like Sen. Bernie Sanders or Sen. Cory Booker — proponents of the “sick and demented ideas” Trump teased about.Sanders and Booker are just two of the 19 Democratic hopefuls Biden will square off against. Other challengers include senators Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris, as well as Beto O’Rourke and Indiana’s Mayor Pete Buttigieg.Biden enjoys a lead over all of these candidates, and, according to one Politico poll, over Trump himself, by a margin of eight points.Much can change between now and November 2020, but Biden appears to have survived his first major scandal unscathed, barely dropping in popularity last month after multiple women came forward and accused him of inappropriate groping and, bizarrely, sniffing. Biden has long been mocked by the right for his handsy, ‘creepy uncle’ behavior, and Trump himself joined in earlier this month, tweeting a fan-made meme video featuring Biden groping and sniffing himself.WELCOME BACK JOE! pic.twitter.com/b2NbBSX3sxThink your friends would be interested?

This violates WTO norms as India has committed zero percent bound tariffs on these products, the EU alleged.",The Financial Express,"Japan has expressed interest to join consultations in a dispute case filed by the EU in the WTO against India’s import duties on some information and communications technology products, including mobile phones, according to a communication of the World Trade Organization. Japan is the sixth country which wants to join the consultations sought by the European Union (EU) against India under the aegis of the WTO’s dispute settlement mechanism. The other countries which have requested are Canada, Thailand, the US, Singapore and Chinese Taipei.On April 9, the EU dragged India into the World Trade Organization’s (WTO) dispute settlement mechanism over Indian import duties on nine categories of information and communications technology (ICT) products, including mobile phones and components, base stations, integrated circuits and optical instruments. They have alleged that imposition of duties infringes WTO norms as India has committed zero per cent bound tariffs on these products. While bound tariffs or duties refer to the ceiling over which a WTO member country cannot impose import duty, the applied tariff is the duty which is currently in place.The EU has alleged that despite India’s legally binding commitment in the WTO that it would not charge any import duty on ICT products, India has been applying duties ranging from 7.5 per cent to 20 per cent. “These import duties are therefore in clear breach by India of WTO rules. The levies affect EU exports worth 600 million euros per year,” the EU has said. According to WTO rules, seeking consultation is the first step of dispute settlement process. If the bilateral consultations requested by the EU with India do not result in a satisfactory solution, the EU can request the WTO to set up a dispute panel to pass a ruling on the matter. As per the WTO rules, these countries would have to seek approval from India and the EU to join the consultation process. Japan in communication to the WTO said it exports to India some of the products particularly cellular mobile phones and their parts.“A number of Japanese companies which export the products at issue have continued to express their serious concerns on India’s tariff increase on those products,” it said. For these reasons, Japan has a substantial trade interest in the consultations and wishes to join in the consultation, it added. “Japan looks forward to receiving confirmation of acceptance of this request as well as being informed of the date and venue of the consultations,” the communication said.

And portraying the Asgardian superhero for eight years now is Australian actor Chris Hemsworth. The 35-year-old star shot to fame playing Kim Hyde in the TV series Home and Away (2004-07), followed by his big screen debut with Star Trek in 2009.And then he became Thor which led to the movies like The Avengers (2012), Thor: The Dark World (2013), Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015), Doctor Strange (2016), Thor: Ragnarok (2017), Avengers: Infinity War (2018) and now, Avengers: Endgame. Hemsworth won most awards in his career playing Thor, including the coveted People’s Choice Awards for Favourite Action Movie Actor (2016). Ahead of the April 26 release of Avengers: Endgame, we catch up with the actor for a chat.Excerpts:Have you seen Avengers: Endgame yet?
No, we’ve been doing the press tour and everyone is like, “Tell us about the movie!” and we can’t tell you anything. I’ve never felt more like a fan of this whole thing as much as anyone else. I am just as interested to see if I live or die. I have a rough idea about it, but I don’t know how it ends. This [Avengers series] has 22 films now, [made] across 10 to 11 years, and I don’t think anything in cinematic history has ever been building to a film like this — with this kind of a journey.WATCH TRAILER:If you’re not killed in Endgame, would you do another Marvel movie?
Loki, my brother has come back nine times, and keeps appearing, so who knows what’s in store. Personally, I’d be happy to do more [movies] if they wanted me.You’ve played Thor under five different directors. Not many actors get to do this outside the Marvel Cinematic Universe, save for a James Bond. Do you see yourself having a share of ownership of who Thor is, or do you give in to the director’s vision?In the first three-four films, I completely gave myself over to whatever the director’s vision was, and some huge positives came from that. But looking back, I wish I would’ve spoken up more, at different times. It was only by the third Thor, that I had a bigger voice of what my creative spin on it would be. Luckily, it was along what the director wanted to do in that movie.It gave me a greater sense of confidence, coming into Infinity War and Endgame, protective of what the new Thor was, and I said let’s keep doing this. That’s when they said, “Well, we’ve got something different for you again!” At first, I was like “Nah, I’m going to lose control”. But it became this wonderful collaboration and I feel like I did something very different in these two films.How was the last week on set? How hard was it to let everything sink in?
There was a greater sense of effort — like we wouldn’t rush back to our trials in between setups and every lunch we attended, we’d eat together. We started hanging out a lot more away from the set. It did have a sense of nostalgia, and looking back at what we’ve done in the years — when we first came, when we played this character and (Robert) Downey (Jr) orchestrated that a lot.He was the first one in and he really was reminding us all, saying “look how special this is”. Not that there was any lack of appreciation from any of us, he was the one who kicked it off the way he did.

A poor show with the gloves saw Pant losing the spot for the second wicket-keeper in the WC squad to a more experienced Dinesh Karthik.

Steyn had gone unsold at the auction for the tournament but came as a replacement to feature in IPL after a two-year gap.",CricTracker,"The Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) registered a hat-trick of victories with a win over the Kings XI Punjab (KXIP) on Wednesday. The tables started to turn for them with Dale Steyn’s arrival who was signed as Nathan Coulter-Nile’s replacement. He played his first match of the season on April 19 against the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) and then the Chennai Super Kings (CSK) to pick a total of four wickets.However, the fast bowler missed the KXIP game which surprised everyone. RCB’s bowling attack was full of confidence after his arrival and Steyn picked wickets in the powerplay which the team hadn’t managed at all earlier in the season. The luxury of the South African superstar lasted only for a couple of matches for RCB as he has been ruled out of the rest of the season. Steyn sustained a shoulder injury according to Cricbuzz and more details are yet to be revealed.AdvertisementDale Steyn’s IPL stint didn’t even last a week but he surely turned back the clock in the two matches he played. RCB defeated KKR and CSK, two of the strongest teams in the tournament, and Steyn played a major role in it. Upon his arrival, Virat Kohli‘s men picked seven wickets in the powerplay in two outings which they hadn’t managed even in the nine matches collectively earlier.Kohli even mentioned during one of the pre or post-match interviews that Steyn joining the team has increased the confidence of the young bowlers like Navdeep Saini. Steyn, in his less than a week stay in India, made it memorable and most importantly, changed RCB’s fate in the season.At least they are off the last place in the points table and it will be interesting to see if they continue to win their remaining matches in his absence.",https://www.crictracker.com/ipl-2019-dale-steyn-ruled-out-of-the-remainder-of-the-season/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

20431,Human organs made transparent by scientists in Germany,"Scientists in Germany, led by Ali ErtÃ¼rk at Ludwig Maximilian University, have used a solvent to make human organs transparent. They did so to better capture the entire structure, including blood vessels and cells in their specific location for improving 3D organ printing. ""I believe we're much closer to a real human organ for the first time now,"" ErtÃ¼rk said.",Reuters,"MUNICH (Reuters) - Researchers in Germany have created transparent human organs using a new technology that could pave the way to print three-dimensional body parts such as kidneys for transplants. Scientists led by Ali Erturk at Ludwig Maximilians University in Munich have developed a technique that uses a solvent to make organs such as the brain and kidneys transparent. The organ is then scanned by lasers in a microscope that allows researchers to capture the entire structure, including the blood vessels and every single cell in its specific location. Using this blueprint, researchers print out the scaffold of the organ. They then load the 3D printer with stem cells which act as “ink” and are injected into the correct position making the organ functional. While 3D printing is already used widely to produce spare parts for industry, Erturk said the development marks a step forward for 3D printing in the medical field. Until now 3D-printed organs lacked detailed cellular structures because they were based on images from computer tomography or MRI machines, he said. “We can see where every single cell is located in transparent human organs. And then we can actually replicate exactly the same, using 3D bioprinting technology to make a real functional organ,” he said. “Therefore, I believe we are much closer to a real human organ for the first time now.” Erturk’s team plan to start by creating a bioprinted pancreas over the next 2-3 years and also hope to develop a kidney within 5-6 years. The researchers will first test to see whether animals can survive with the bioprinted organs and could start clinical trials within 5-10 years, he said.

20444,China warns off French warship after it enters Taiwan Strait,"The Chinese Navy warned off a French warship that entered the Taiwan Strait earlier this month, claiming it made an illegal passage. Following the incident, China reportedly withdrew an invitation to France to participate in a naval parade to mark 70 years since the founding of its Navy, reports said. China claims Taiwan as part of its territory.",Reuters,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A French warship passed through the strategic Taiwan Strait this month, U.S. officials told Reuters, a rare voyage by a vessel of a European country that is likely to be welcomed by Washington but increase tension with Beijing. The passage, which was confirmed by China, is a sign that U.S. allies are increasingly asserting freedom of navigation in international waterways near China. It could open the door for other allies, such as Japan and Australia, to consider similar operations.  The French operation comes amid increasing tensions between the United States and China. Taiwan is one of a growing number of flashpoints in the U.S.-China relationship, which also include a trade war, U.S. sanctions and China’s increasingly muscular military posture in the South China Sea, where the United States also conducts freedom of navigation patrols. Two officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said a French military vessel carried out the transit in the narrow waterway between China and Taiwan on April 6. One of the officials identified the warship as the French frigate Vendemiaire and said it was shadowed by the Chinese military. The official was not aware of any previous French military passage through the Taiwan Strait. The officials said that as a result of the passage, China notified France it was no longer invited to a naval parade to mark the 70 years since the founding of China’s Navy. Warships from India, Australia and several other nations participated. China said on Thursday it had lodged “stern representations” with France for what it called an “illegal” passage. “China’s military sent navy ships in accordance with the law and the rules to identify the French ship and warn it to leave,” defense ministry spokesman Ren Guoqiang told a regularly scheduled media briefing, while declining to say if the sailing had led to the withdrawal of France’s invitation to the parade of ships this week. “China’s military will stay alert to firmly safeguard China’s sovereignty and security,” he said. Colonel Patrik Steiger, the spokesman for France’s military chief of staff, declined to comment on an operational mission.  The U.S. officials did not speculate on the purpose of the passage or whether it was designed to assert freedom of navigation. The French strait passage comes against the backdrop of increasingly regular passages by U.S. warships through the strategic waterway. Last month, the United States sent Navy and Coast Guard ships through the Taiwan Strait. The passages upset China, which claims self-ruled Taiwan as part of its territory. Beijing has been ramping up pressure to assert its sovereignty over the island. Chen Chung-chi, spokesman for Taiwan’s defense ministry, told Reuters by phone the strait is part of busy international waters and it is “a necessity” for vessels from all countries to transit through it. He said Taiwan’s defense ministry will continue to monitor movement of foreign vessels in the region. “This is an important development both because of the transit itself but also because it reflects a more geopolitical approach by France towards China and the broader Asia-Pacific,” said Abraham Denmark, a former U.S. deputy assistant secretary of defense for East Asia. The transit is a sign that countries like France are not only looking at China through the lens of trade but from a military standpoint as well, Denmark said.  Last month, France and China signed deals worth billions of euros during a visit to Paris by Chinese President Xi Jinping. French President Emmanuel Macron wants to forge a united European front to confront Chinese advances in trade and technology. “It is important to have other countries operating in Asia to demonstrate that this is just not a matter of competition between Washington and Beijing, that what China has been doing represents a broader challenge to a liberal international order,” Denmark, who is with the Woodrow Wilson Center think-tank in Washington, added. Washington has no formal ties with Taiwan but is bound by law to help provide the island with the means to defend itself and is its main source of arms.

20445,US Navy SEALs were warned against reporting war crimes,A group of US Navy SEAL commandos alleges it was warned by their troop commander against reporting their platoon leader for possible war crimes in Iraq. The commandos were told that speaking out could cost them and others their career. The accusations against Special Operations Chief Edward Gallagher include stabbing a teenage captive to death and opening fire on civilians.,RT,"Special Operations Chief Edward ‘Blade’ Gallagher, 39, a highly decorated platoon chief, has been accused by several members of his platoon of committing atrocities in Iraq. These include: indiscriminately bombarding civilian neighborhoods with rocket and machine-gun fire, opening fire on civilians without provocation and summarily executing a captured, teenage Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS) fighter who was undergoing medical treatment by US medics, by stabbing him repeatedly with a custom-made knife and hatchet.He was arrested in September on more than a dozen charges including premeditated murder and attempted murder, all of which he denies. He faces life in prison and was detained in the Navy brig following his arrest amid fears he was attempting to intimidate witnesses and undermine the investigation.Seven members of Gallagher’s platoon called a meeting in March 2018 at Naval Base Coronado outside of San Diego to request a formal investigation but they were rebuffed and told that speaking out could cost them their careers. Prior to the hearing they had repeatedly warned top brass of the behavior and were ignored.  “Stop talking about it,” they were reportedly told by one of the investigators.Following his arrest, some 40 Republican members of Congress signed a letter calling for Gallagher's release ahead of his trial. US President Donald Trump later announced in March that Gallagher would be moved to “less restrictive confinement” pending his court martial which is set to begin May 28.In honor of his past service to our Country, Navy Seal #EddieGallagher will soon be moved to less restrictive confinement while he awaits his day in court.

20447,Companies do better with women in leadership roles: IMA chief,"Institute of Management Accountants' (IMA) Global Board of Directors Chair Virginia White has said, ""It's been known by the NYSE that companies perform better when they have women leaders in the C-Suite,"" referring to positions like CEO, COO, CFO and CTO. She added some statistics state companies having only one woman in C-Suite, specifically in HR role, don't perform well.",The News Minute,"IMA® (Institute of Management Accountants) hosted the third edition of its Women’s Accounting Leadership Series for accounting and finance professionals in the Middle East and India in Bengaluru on April 17, 2019. The conference was supported by Amazon and The University of Manchester. The series aimed at encouraging women professionals in finance and accounting to break the “glass ceiling” in business leadership. The Series brought together female professionals in finance and accounting to discuss the challenges and issues in their careers to reach decision-making roles within their organisations. Top Indian women in the business and finance sector participated in the conference to share their experience and insights on accounting leadership.IMA is one of the largest and most respected associations focused exclusively on advancing the management accounting profession. Globally, IMA supports the profession through research, the CMA (Certified Management Accountant) program, continuing education, networking and advocacy of the highest ethical business practices. IMA has a global network of more than 100,000 members in 140 countries and 300 professional and student chapters. Ginger White is the IMA Chair for 2018-2019 and is only the fifth woman to hold IMA’s most senior volunteer role in its 100-year history. She spoke to TNM about various aspects including the challenges confronting women today, benefits of gender diversity at the workplace, how automation will impact finance.Here are excerpts. What do you think are the challenges that exist for women today? When I think about it, education breaks down those barriers or challenges and the other thing is confidence. Helping one another become confident because we have such amazing skills as women that really bring people together. We have that nurturing skill just naturally and so we can help develop the future generation of leaders. It’s interesting as I sit here in the Women’s Accounting Leadership Series in Bengaluru, the same challenges exist no matter where you are in the world for women. So we’ve led a lot of these in the US for the last few years and the themes are common and we like to talk to those women who have broken the glass ceiling. And also being open about how we can help other women, promote themselves basically together collectively. Benefits of gender diversity at the workplaceIt’s been known by the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) that companies perform better when they have women leaders in the C-Suite (CEO, CFO, COO etc.) and there are some statistics which say that if there’s only one woman in the C-suite and that one woman is in HR, companies don’t perform well. So there’s metrics around that which suggest that when you have women leaders at the top, it definitely improves performance. What are the hurdles for women to rise to leadership positions?Some of the biggest hurdles could be ourselves quite honestly, because I think sometimes as women, we are most critical of ourselves. So, some of things that help build confidence is education. The more education you can get, it helps in taking on leadership roles. Women are mostly risk-averse though we are getting there. So just changing our mindset is a big, critical success factor. What can companies do to help women who want to start a family?Companies have realised that it’s a challenge for women to get to the C-Suite and to actually maintain that skill set required. So when I think of women starting families, the husband needs to also share what may have commonly been known as women duties in the home. So, in the US that’s becoming much more the case. I don’t know about cultures here if they have shifted yet. Secondly, a lot of companies have allowed women to just work part-time. Another thing some companies have done is they have also given paternity leave. So in the past, it was 2 weeks but they are extending that. It kind of helps level the playing field and remove that perceived differentiation. Do you see a gradual transformation in the number of women in leadership roles? Absolutely, I have seen that. When I think of GM (General Motors), Mary Barra, she is the CEO and is the first woman CEO of a top automotive company. The company’s CFO is also a female. It’s changing and I think as women, we owe it to them and they are amazing women and they are good role models that we want to emulate. How will automation and AI impact accounting and finance? That is one of our big things that we manage every day at the Institute of Management Accountants. We are embracing that change. We see it as a lot of the jobs that are being done today will go away and that’s one of our big initiatives within the IMA is that we want to prepare our members to pivot with that change. So we have a lot of data analytics. We are trying to make sure that our members that are currently in the workforce are making that change; educating them; making them capable so that when their old positions get eliminated, they have a place to go. We have a certification for our CMA (Certified Management Accountants). We have something called the CSCA i.e. Certified Strategy and Competitive Analysis), that’s really more around the mid-level where individuals could pivot into strategy. Thinking of how to help our members manage that lifecycle transformative change in a very nice way, not in a fearful way. So really making our members embrace the change because it’s coming. It’s really exciting times in the management accounting profession. ",https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/companies-do-better-women-leaders-c-suite-ima-chair-ginger-white-tnm-100654?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

In under three months, on Thursday, 25 April, the Army issued a formal advertisement, calling for women to join as Soldier General Duty.Also Read : Army Chief Vs Manikarnika: Busting Old Myths About Women SoldiersReacting to the news, lawyer and military expert Navdeep Singh said that the official advertisement was a historic step that would open more avenues for women in armed forces.“Till now, women were being recruited in the Indian Army in officer ranks. The Army first inducted women in 1994. After that, more than two decades have passed and there was no further entry at any other level. This is the first time women are joining as jawans,” Navdeep Singh told The Quint.However, he also pointed that the government or the Army is nowhere close to recruiting more women and more branches, and it is likely that this is an experiment.“Let us see where this takes us, but I am very positive about it. It will take some time but with time and experiment more avenues will open up. After all, they have been performing exceptionally in Central Armed Police Forces,” said Singh.He also added that while he expected the Navy and the Air Force to open up first and the Indian Army to follow suit.According to a tweet by Defence Minister, in January, ""The women will be inducted in a graded manner to eventually comprise 20 percent of total Corps of Military Police of the Army.""Also Read : Dear Defence Minister: Give Women Officers a Bigger Playing FieldIn another notification on 5 March, the Ministry said it has taken steps to ensure implementation of permanent commissioning of women officers in the armed forces, in line with the announcement made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his Independence Day speech.Women officers will be granted permanent commission in the Indian Army in ""all the ten branches"" where women are inducted for Short Service Commission, the statement said.""So, besides the existing two streams of Judge Advocate General (JAG) and Army Education Corps, now permanent commission will be granted in Signals, Engineers, Army Aviation, Army Air Defence, Electronics and Mechanical Engineers, Army Service Corps, Army Ordinance Corps and Intelligence also to women officers.”(Hi there!

Users can find the option under the 'sticker tray' icon in Stories, through which they can pose a question with up to four choices, and post the Story. Users can later view their followers' answers.",BGR,"Instagram has just launched a new Quiz sticker which enables its users to ask multiple-choice answers. The new sticker comes about two years after the company initially launched its polls stickers allowing its users to conduct polls with its then recently introduced stories section. Similar to the polls sticker, the quiz sticker can also only be used on Instagram stories this means that there are no overall new changes in the behavior of stories as well as the posts. To make the announcement, the company took to its official Twitter handle and posted a 30-second clip showcasing how the new sticker works.Instagram summarized the feature stating that “Starting today, you can use the new quiz sticker in Stories to ask your friends and followers a multiple-choice question. See how well your friends know you.” To get started with the new sticker, users need to go to the section where they add a new Instagram story and then click a picture or select a photo from the gallery as the background or context of the story. Once that is done, tap on the “Sticker Tray” button at the top of the screen and then select the “Quiz” sticker.After you have selected the “Quiz” sticker, a blank template of the sicker will appear where you can add the question and different options as part of the multi-choice question. It is worth noting that users can only add four different options as options to their “Quiz”. The template screen also comes with a rainbow-colored button on the top which can be used to change the color of the “Quiz” template. Users can hit the “Done” button on the top right corner once they are satisfied with their question and the associated options.This new feature comes just weeks after the company added its new “Instagram Checkout” features allowing users to make a purchase without leaving the app. The “Quiz” sticker is available for both Android and iOS apps at the time of writing. Though, make sure that you have the latest version of the app to get access to the new feature. The company has continuously worked towards adding new features to the platform to take on Snapchat and other competing platforms. In addition to new features like “Check out” and shopping, Instagram has also worked on new ways for users to interact with each other on the platform including music on stories and more.",https://www.bgr.in/news/instagram-launches-a-new-quiz-sticker-allowing-users-to-ask-multiple-choice-questions-in-stories/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
