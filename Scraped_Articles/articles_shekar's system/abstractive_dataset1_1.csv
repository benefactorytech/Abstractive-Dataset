19058,US ride-hailing app drivers to strike ahead of Uber IPO,"Uber, Lyft, among other ride-hailing app drivers in New York City will go on strike on May 8 shortly before Uber goes public to protest alleged unfair employment conditions, a taxi union said. Drivers in Los Angeles, other cities, also expected to strike. ""Uber executives are getting rich off...our work. They should treat us with respect,"" a union member said.",Reuters,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Uber Technologies Inc’s drivers in New York will go on strike next week shortly before the ride-hailing company goes public to protest what they view as unfair employment conditions, a taxi union said on Friday. The protests underscore the challenge for Uber of finding a way to lower driver costs in order to become profitable and paying drivers enough to retain their services.  Drivers for Uber, as well Lyft Inc and other ride-hailing apps, will strike on Wednesday for two hours, beginning at 7 a.m. ET (1100 GMT). Uber currently expects to price its IPO on Thursday and begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange the following day.  The drivers join peers in San Francisco, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Diego, Philadelphia and Washington, D.C., who are also planning to strike. The New York Taxi Workers Alliance (NYTWA) said the drivers are demanding job security, livable incomes and a cap on the amount ride-hailing companies can collect from fares.  “Uber claims that we are independent contractors even though they set our rates and control our work day,” Sonam Lama, a NYTWA member and Uber driver since 2015, said in a statement.  “Uber executives are getting rich off of our work. They should treat us with respect. We are striking to send a message that drivers will keep rising up,” Lama said. Uber cautioned in its IPO filing that its business would be “adversely affected” if drivers were classified as employees instead of independent contractors. The company hopes to be valued at between $80.5 billion and $91.5 billion. Uber has yet to turn a profit. It reported a net loss for the first quarter of 2019.  “I voted to go on strike because drivers need job security,” said Henry Rolands, an NYTWA member and Lyft driver.  Uber did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Lyft said in an emailed statement that its drivers’ hourly earnings have increased over the last two year. “Over 75 percent drive less than 10 hours a week to supplement their existing jobs. On average, drivers nationwide earn over $20 per hour,” Lyft said.

""This is not smuggling. This is countering sanctions which we do not see as just or legitimate,"" he said. The US has told importers of Iranian oil to stop purchases by May 1 or face sanctions.",Reuters,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran has mobilised all its resources to sell oil in a “grey market”, bypassing U.S. sanctions that Tehran sees as illegitimate, state media quoted Deputy Oil Minister Amir Hossein Zamaninia as saying on Sunday. The United States, which last year withdrew from a 2015 Iran nuclear deal with world powers, has told buyers of Iranian oil to stop purchases by May 1 or face sanctions. Iran says it will continue to export oil in defiance of U.S. sanctions, part of a campaign by Washington aimed at halting Tehran’s ballistic missile programme and curbing its regional power. “We have mobilised all of the country’s resources and are selling oil in the ‘grey market’,” state news agency IRNA quoted Zamaninia as saying. Zamaninia gave no details about the “grey market”, but Iran is widely reported to have sold oil at steep discounts and often through private firms during sanctions earlier this decade. “We certainly won’t sell 2.5 million barrels per day as under the (nuclear deal),” Zamaninia said, giving no figures for current sales.  “We will need to make serious decisions about our financial and economic management, and the government is working on that.”   “This is not smuggling. This is countering sanctions which we do not see as just or legitimate,” Zamaninia said.

19062,Govt has little hope of finding buyer for Jet Airways: Reports,"The government sees little hope of a bidder emerging for cash-strapped Jet Airways, reports said citing government sources. Parties that had initially expressed interest in Jet, which is in over $1-billion debt, have reportedly failed to make firm bids. The temporarily grounded airline's bidding process, for which four suitors have reportedly been shortlisted, will be finalised by May 10.",Reuters,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India’s government sees little hope of a bidder emerging for debt-laden Jet Airways Ltd, two senior finance ministry officials said, even as thousands of employees plead with the government for a rescue. Parties that had initially expressed interest in Jet, which is saddled with roughly $1.2 billion of debt, have so far failed to make firm bids to bail it out, increasing the odds that it could soon face bankruptcy proceedings. “There is little scope in the revival of Jet,” said one official, adding that if a bidder emerged, the government was still willing to return slots to the private airline which have temporarily been given to rivals. A second senior finance ministry official said it was only a matter of time before someone dragged Jet to the National Company Law Tribunal - India’s bankruptcy court - for recovery of dues from Jet. It will most likely be one of Jet’s creditors and not its lenders that do so, said both the officials who spoke on condition of anonymity. Unions have been pleading with the government to ensure the airline is rescued. Last week, in a letter to the prime minister seen by Reuters, its pilots union urged the government to intervene and speed up the bid process for the airline and stop the deregistration of its aircraft by its lessors. Jet had a fleet of more than 120 aircraft but more than half have been deregistered and repossessed by lessors.  India’s aviation authorities have also been temporarily farming out Jet’s slots to rival carriers as airfares have soared in the wake of Jet’s shutdown. Rival low-cost carriers have also been scooping up aircraft that were formerly operated by Jet from its lessors, and poaching hundreds of its pilots, cabin crew and other staffers. The airline halted operations on April 17 after its lenders refused to provide further funds to keep it afloat. Once India’s largest private carrier, it had more than 16,000 employees and flights to dozens of international destinations. State Bank of India (SBI) said last month that it expected bidders to submit binding bids by April 30, and to complete the sale process this month. However, bankers involved in the process told Reuters last week that no binding bids had emerged. “The banks have been advised to wait for the formation of the next government ... before taking any decision on Jet’s fate,” the official told Reuters. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is currently seeking re-election. His government has come under fire from critics and opposition parties for rising unemployment. Despite this, senior government officials have opposed any bailout package for the airline arguing it would increase pressure to support other failed private companies. The government is satisfied with the handling of the Jet crisis by banks and other institutions as it has thus far not become a major election issue, the second ministry official said. Jet’s borrowings are small compared to those of other big defaulters such as Videocon and some steel companies, so lenders likely can wait for some more time before commencing bankruptcy proceedings, the official said. An official at ICICI Bank, which has to recover over 5.4 billion rupees ($78.17 million) from Jet, said the bank sees little chance of any recovery without the government coming up with a rescue plan.  “We largely think our money in Jet is gone,” he said.

In India alone, more than a million people suffer from bilateral loss of vision due to corneal injuries, with many more suffering from unilateral corneal blindness.While corneal transplants, through the surgical removal of the opaque corneal tissue, is an effective way to improve vision, there is currently an acute shortage of cadaveric human corneas available for transplantation.Scientists at Pandorum have now developed a novel hydrogel that can deliver corneal stem cells in the wound site to help in the scarless repair and regeneration of corneal tissues.The hydrogel can be directly applied to corneal injuries in a minimally invasive manner. It can also be 3D bio-printed as corneal lenticules, or as a disc-shaped piece of corneal tissue, that can be used for lamellar keratoplasty, a surgical procedure for the partial replacement of the damaged cornea.“Being able to bio-engineer critical tissues such as the human cornea is a major milestone for all of us,"" Arun Chandru, co-founder and Director of Pandorum Technologies, told YourStory.He adds,Founded in 2011 by Arun Chandru and Dr. Tuhin Bhowmick, both researchers from Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore, Pandorum is supported by the Department of Biotechnology’s Biotechnology Industry Research Assistance Council (BIRAC) and has labs at the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Platforms, Bangalore, and at the Bangalore BioInnovation Centre.Also read: Meet the Bengaluru scientists who have grown artificial liver tissuesDr Vivek Singh and Dr Tuhin Bhowmick presenting the pre-clinical data on Pandorum's bio-engineered human cornea tissue at ARVO-2019 Annual Meet in Vancouver, CanadaThe biotech startup presented its pre-clinical trial findings related to the bio-engineered human cornea tissue at annual meeting of the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology (ARVO-2019), Vancouver, Canada.

Countering the Olympian vs Olympian narrative that dominates the closely fought contest between him and Congress candidate and Olympian Krishna Poonia, Rathore, in an exclusive interview to Times Now, said that the newly elected Rajasthan government has been playing politics around the sentiments of farmers and youth by 'blocking' the schemes rolled out by the Modi government.Campaigning extensively in his constituency ahead of the June 6 polls, Rathore said that 'undercurrent' for PM Modi is 'stronger' than the 'Modi wave' that helped BJP sweep all the 25 Parliamentary seats in the desert state in 2014. He strongly advocated for the benefits of his government's initiatives such as GST, demonetisation and hit out at Congress president for getting his 'mathematics wrong' with his party's NYAY scheme.""What game are we playing?

""The PM announced PM Samman Nidhi for farmers who own the land below two hectares.. the state govt was supposed to give us a list of farmers who own two hectares of land.""Rathore said that 30 lakh farmers from Rajasthan applied for the scheme, but the Rajasthan government sat on the applications and did not share the details with the Centre. ""Just so that before elections, PM should not be allowed to transfer money. This is politics. They also blocked the benefits of central health scheme from reaching the poor,"" he said.The Congress party has reached out to farmers and the 'poor' with NYAY scheme in its manifesto.

            He, however, remained evasive on who could be the Prime Minister if the UPA were to get the majority, saying it will be decided by the alliance after the results are declared.Sibal, a prominent lawyer and former Union Minister, was asked why the Congress is reluctant to declare Gandhi as its Prime Ministerial candidate.“If the Congress were to get 272 (seats), there would be no hesitation,” he replied.When insisted that the Congress could still project Gandhi as its Prime Ministerial candidate and say that he would be the Prime Minister if the party gets the majority, he shot back: “Without any doubt… If we get the majority, is there any doubt?… (But) there is no question of saying it. We know we won’t get the majority. We know we won’t get 272 (seats), just as we know that the BJP will not get more than 160 seats.”When pointed out to him that he was making a big statement, he responded: “Why not? Of course, we will not get (the majority). There is no chance.”Sibal was asked again whether he wanted to say that Congress will not get the majority, to which he replied: “We will not get 272 on our own. It will be foolish for me to say that. And BJP will get less than 160.”At the same time, he said the Congress-led UPA will be ahead in the elections and could form the government even as it has to fight out with ‘mahagathbandan’, an alliance of some Opposition parties, in states like Uttar Pradesh.Asked who could be the Prime Minister if the Congress-led UPA gets the majority, Sibal said it will be decided by the alliance. “…All that will happen after May 23 (when results are declared).”Queried if there could be anybody else than Gandhi, he said: “I don’t know. The alliance will decide… It is something that alliance partners will have to decide. As far as Congress party is concerned, he (Rahul) is the undisputed leader in the Congress party. Let’s be clear on that.”On questions regarding the efficacy of the ‘mahagathbandan’, Sibal said it was “never floated by the Congress”.“Our ‘gathbandans’ are intact. Ours is a party which is gathbandan (alliance) plus. All our gathbandans existing prior to 2014 are intact, whether it is NCP or DMK… We have added two more – JDS in Karnataka and CPI-M in West Bengal.”When pointed out that the Samajwadi Party (SP), which was earlier with the Congress, has drifted away and joined hands with Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), Sibal said: “That is not our fault. Our alliance partners are intact. We have not let down any of them but we have added our alliance partners.”He said alliance with the Samajwadi Party could have happened if that party had “recognised our importance as a national party”.“But (BSP chief) Mayawati consistently opposed it. They distributed seats among themselves and said we have left two seats for the Congress.

No image will surpass this one until future space telescopes are launched, NASA added.",Engadget,"The Hubble Space Telescope has been capturing tons of space images since it entered orbit in 1990. Now, NASA has put together a mosaic photo using 16 years' worth of data to create one of the widest views of the universe we've ever seen. The image, called Hubble Legacy Field, was created from 7,500 individual exposures captured in wavelengths spanning from ultraviolet to near-infrared light by 31 different programs. It encompasses a region in the sky that includes those shown in older Hubble mosaics -- the Ultra Deep Field and the eXtreme Deep Field -- and contains 265,000 galaxies. That's 30 times as many galaxies as previous deep field images, enough to cover an area that's almost as wide as the moon.While the eXtreme Deep Field is still our deepest look into the universe, the Legacy Field also gives us a glimpse of the early cosmos -- a time ""when small, young galaxies collided and merged with other galaxies,"" NASA explained. It shows the state of galaxies as far back as 13.3 billion years ago, or just 500 million years after the Big Bang.NASA says no image will surpass the Legacy Field's scope until future telescopes make their way to orbit. That could take years and years, though, seeing as Hubble's successor, the James Webb telescope, won't be launching until 2021. Garth Illingworth, who led the team that assembled the image, said:""This one image contains the full history of the growth of galaxies in the universe, from their time as 'infants' to when they grew into fully fledged 'adults...' We've put together this mosaic as a tool to be used by us and by other astronomers. The expectation is that this survey will lead to an even more coherent, in-depth and greater understanding of the universe's evolution in the coming years.""",https://www.engadget.com/2019/05/04/nasas-hubble-legacy-field-image/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

The country spent over $111 billion on oil imports in FY19, up from $87.8 billion in the previous fiscal. PM Modi had earlier said India needs to bring oil import dependence down to 67% by 2022.",Times Now,"New Delhi: Prime Minister Narendra Modi may have set a target to cut India's oil import dependence by 10 per cent but the country's reliance on foreign oil for meeting its energy needs has jumped to a multi-year high of nearly 84 per cent, latest government data showed.
Speaking at the 'Urja Sangam' conference in March 2015, the Prime Minister had said that India needs to bring down its oil import dependence from 77 per cent in 2013-14 to 67 per cent by 2022 when India will celebrate its 75th year of independence.Further, the dependence can be cut to half by 2030, he had said. But with consumption growing at a brisk pace and domestic output remaining stagnant, India's oil import dependence has risen from 82.9 per cent in 2017-18 to 83.7 per cent in 2018-19, according to the oil ministry's Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell (PPAC).Import dependence in 2015-16 was 80.6 per cent, which rose to 81.7 per cent in the following year, PPAC said. The country's oil consumption grew from 184.7 million tonnes in 2015-16 to 194.6 million tonnes in the following year and 206.2 million tonnes in the year thereafter. In 2018-19, demand grew by 2.6 per cent to 211.6 million tonnes.In contrast, domestic output continues to fall. India's crude oil output fell from 36.9 million tonnes in 2015-16 to 36 million tonnes in 2016-17. The trend of negative growth continues in the following years as well as output fell to 35.7 million tonnes in 2017-18 and to 34.2 million tonnes in the fiscal year that ended on March 31, 2019, PPAC data showed.The government is focusing on measures like increasing domestic production, promoting the use of biofuel and energy conservation to reduce dependence on imported crude oil. It changed exploration rules multiple times during the last five years to get the elusive private and foreign investment.The previous New Exploration Licensing Policy (NELP) was changed to Hydrocarbon Exploration and Licensing Policy (HELP) promising pricing and marketing freedom.HELP brought in open acreage licensing policy that gave companies the freedom to choose areas they want to explore. Discovered oil and gas fields, taken away from state-owned firms, were also auctioned but neither this nor the open acreage policy managed to get big names to invest in exploration and production of oil and gas.According to PPAC, India spent USD 111.9 billion on oil imports in 2018-19, up from USD 87.8 billion in the previous fiscal year. The import bill was USD 64 billion in 2015-16.For the current fiscal, it projected crude oil imports to rise to 233 million tonnes and foreign exchange spending on it to marginally increase to USD 112.7 billion.State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp's (ONGC) output fell to 19.6 million tonnes in 2018-19 from 20.8 million tonnes in the previous year. ONGC's oil production was 20.9 million tonnes in 2016-17 and 21.1 million tonnes in 2015-16.

19104,"N Korea tests rocket launchers, tactical guided weapons","North Korea has conducted a ""strike drill"" for multiple launchers, firing tactical guided weapons in a military drill supervised by leader Kim Jong-un on Saturday. Kim said the drill was carried out to ""increase North Korea's combat ability"". Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump said Kim realises his country's ""great economic potential"" and ""will do nothing to interfere or end it"".",Reuters,"SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea has conducted a “strike drill” for multiple launchers, firing tactical guided weapons into the East Sea in a military drill supervised by leader Kim Jong Un on Saturday, the North’s state media reported on Sunday. The purpose of the drill was to test performance of “large-caliber long-range multiple rocket launchers and tactical guided weapons by defense units,” the Korean Central News Agency said. Photographs released by KCNA showed the tactical guided weapons fired could be short-range, ground-to-ground ballistic missiles, according to Kim Dong-yub, a military expert at Korea’s Kyungnam University’s Institute of Far Eastern (IFE)Studies. While such a missile launch would be in violation of UN Security Council Resolutions, at least it would not involve long-range ballistic missiles that have been seen as a threat to the United States.    “What was sobering for me was that unexpectedly, there was a photo of short-range, ground-to-ground ballistic missile, otherwise known as the North’s version of Iskander,” said IFE’s Kim. The new, solid fuel ballistic missiles can fly as far as 500 kilometers (311 miles), putting the entire Korean Peninsula within its range, and are capable of neutralizing the advanced U.S. anti-missile defense system (THAAD) deployed in South Korea, the military analyst said.  The South Korean defense ministry, however, put the range of weapons fired from the east coast city of Wonsan around 9 a.m. (0000 GMT) on Saturday at between 70 to 240 km (44 to 149 miles).  Giving orders for the test firing, North Korean leader Kim stressed the need to “increase the combat ability so as to defend the political sovereignty and economic self-sustenance” of North Korea in the face of threats and invasions, the report said.  The statement came a day after the test firing, which analysts interpreted as an attempt to exert pressure on Washington to give ground in negotiations to end the North’s nuclear program after a summit in February ended in failure. North Korea had maintained a freeze in nuclear and ballistic missiles testing in place since 2017, which U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly pointed out as an important achievement from his engagement with Pyongyang. “With North Korea never promising to completely stop all missile testing - it only promised a self-imposed moratorium of testing long-range missiles such as ICBMs that can hit the U.S. homeland - we should not be shocked by North Korea’s short-range launch,” said Harry Kazianis, director of Korean Studies at the Center for the National Interest. The latest test firing prompted Seoul on Saturday to call on its communist neighbor to “stop acts that escalate military tension on the Korean Peninsula.” Trump said in a Twitter post that he was still confident he could have a deal with Kim. “I believe that Kim Jong Un fully realizes the great economic potential of North Korea, & will do nothing to interfere or end it,” Trump wrote. “He also knows that I am with him & does not want to break his promise to me. Deal will happen!” U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on “Fox News Sunday” the missiles were short range. The testing freeze has been “focused, very focused” on intercontinental missile systems, the ones that stand to threaten the United States,” Pompeo said. The administration wants to “continue to work toward a peaceful resolution to achieve denuclearization,” he added. The South Korean military initially described the test as a missile launch, but subsequently gave a vaguer description of “projectiles” and said it was conducting joint analysis with the United States of the latest launches.  “Yes, the tests were the most serious since the end of 2017, but this is largely a warning to Trump that he could lose the talks unless Washington takes partial denuclearization steps offered by Kim,” said Shin Beom-chul, a senior fellow at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies. “A resumption of long-range test could be next unless Kim gets what he wants soon.” Talks stalled after a second summit between Kim and Trump in Hanoi in February failed to produce a deal to end Pyongyang’s nuclear program in return for sanctions relief. North Korea demanded Washington lift the U.S.-led sanctions against it in return for a partial dismantling of its nuclear weapons program, while the United States wanted the quick rollback of the North’s entire nuclear weapons program before removing economic sanctions. The North’s last missile launch was in November 2017, when it tested an intercontinental ballistic missile. Soon after that missile test, the North declared that its nuclear force was complete, after which Pyongyang extended an olive branch to the South and the United States.

19196,US rejects Tesla bid for tariff exemption on China autopilot tech,"US President Donald Trump's administration has rejected Tesla's bid to exempt 25% tariffs on China-made Autopilot Engine Control Unit (ECU), which Tesla refers to as the ""brain"" of its vehicles. The ECU contains Tesla's full self-driving hardware, which CEO Elon Musk recently announced will be standard across new Model 3, S and X vehicles.",Reuters,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. trade officials rejected Tesla Inc’s bid for relief from President Donald Trump’s 25-percent tariffs on the Chinese-made Autopilot “brain” of its Model 3 and other electric vehicles, one of more than 1,000 product denials linked to China’s industrial development plans. According to documents filed by the U.S. Trade Representative’s office (USTR) and reviewed by Reuters, exclusion requests from Tesla and others for Chinese-made products from aircraft parts to biotechnology instruments were denied because they were deemed “strategically important” to the “Made in China 2025” program.  Tesla declined to comment. The company has separate pending tariff exclusion requests for duties on the Chinese-made Model 3 Center Screen and for the Model 3 Car Computer before USTR. Tesla said in a securities filing on Monday: “Our costs for producing our vehicles in the U.S. have also been affected by import duties on certain components sourced from China.” The denials illustrate a systematic approach by the Trump administration to thwart China’s efforts to develop high-technology industries that Washington alleges benefited from theft and forced transfer of U.S. intellectual property. Made in China 2025, a program aimed at growing China’s prowess in 10 strategic industries dominated by the United States, is at the heart of trade negotiations and U.S. demands for sweeping changes to China’s policies. Those industries include new energy and autonomous vehicles, aerospace, semiconductors, biopharmaceuticals, robotics and artificial intelligence.  Tesla first made its request to exclude its 3.0 Autopilot electronic control unit in July 2018, which it called the “brain of the vehicle” when the Palo Alto, California-based automaker warned that “increased tariffs on this particular part cause economic harm to Tesla, through the increase of costs and impact to profitability.” In a March 15 letter, USTR general counsel Stephen Vaughn said the agency was denying Tesla’s request because it “concerns a product strategically important or related to ‘Made in China 2025 or other Chinese industrial programs.” USTR issued a separate letter also denying a request for the earlier 2.5 version of the Autopilot ECU. It was not clear when the letter was posted on a U.S. government website. Other exclusion denials were posted at the same time, including for industrial robots imported by Kawasaki Robotics USA and composite panels made by Hexcel Corp in China for use in various Boeing Co aircraft. Some less high-tech products cited in the 2025 denials included a wiring harness for a rear door imported by Lear Corp’s Chinese joint venture, Kyungshin-Lear Sales and Engineering LLC.  “The material composition of the product consists of insulated wire, connectors, terminals, tape, and conduit,” Kyungshin-Lear said in its request. USTR has received China tariff exclusion requests for nearly 13,000 products and denied 5,311. Of the denials, 1,166, or more than a fifth, contained the same language as the Tesla request, citing links to Made in China 2025.  Tesla told USTR it was unable to find a manufacturer in the United States, adding that “choosing any other supplier would have delayed the (Model 3) program by 18 months with clean room setup, line validation, and staff training.” Tesla says it reflashes the Autopilot ECU with the latest Firmware created in California when it is shipped from China by supplier Quanta Shanghai. “For a product as safety critical to consumers, and critical to the essence of Tesla, we turned to industry experts who could achieve this quality and complexity in addition to the deadlines, which was not possible outside of China,” Tesla wrote. “When it comes to identifying a supplier, we cannot risk our customers’ lives due to a defect from a supplier.” The Autopilot ECU, also used in the Model S and X, includes two printed circuit board assemblies, which Tesla calls “the brain responsible for Tesla’s Autopilot functionality” and the main safety system for the vehicle. Tesla has a separate pending tariff exclusion request filed in December for duties on the Chinese-made Model 3 Center Screen. Other exclusion requests also cited the lack of U.S. sources. Kawasaki said there are no industrial robots manufactured in the United States, and it only produces robots in China and Japan.  In a previously unreported request, Tesla also asked USTR to waive tariffs on the 17-inch (43-cm) cockpit touchscreen control panel that displays navigation, media, audio, climate control, energy display, and all in-cabin controls. Other automakers have sought similar exemptions but have not yet received answers. General Motors Co in late July sought an exemption to a 25-percent U.S. tariff on its Chinese-made Buick Envision sport utility vehicle. The Envision accounted for nearly 15 percent of U.S. Buick sales last year. GM has also sought exclusions for dozen of parts, including push button ignition switches and transmission bearings.  Nissan Motor Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV have also filed exclusion requests for parts, while Uber Technologies Inc asked for an exclusion for electric bikes rented through the Uber app. Even if the United States and China reach a trade deal in the coming weeks to resolve their disputes, companies may not see tariff relief for months or possibly years. People familiar with the talks say that some tariffs, especially those aimed at the Made in China 2025 industries, could remain in place as part of an enforcement mechanism. Vice President Mike Pence said on Friday that the manner in which tariffs were removed would be part of that mechanism, aimed at ensuring China lives up to its obligations in any agreement.

19213,24 lawmakers urge US government not to end India's trade benefits,"Twenty-four US lawmakers have urged the Trump administration not to end duty benefits on $5.6 billion worth of Indian exports. They said ending the benefits would impose ""hundreds of millions of dollars annually in new taxes"" on American companies and may force them to fire employees. They urged the administration to continue negotiating a deal that would protect American jobs.",Reuters,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Twenty-four U.S. members of Congress sent a letter on Friday to  U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, urging him not to end a vital trade concession for India, a day before the Trump administration is likely to announce a decision on it. Ending the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP), which allows preferential duty-free imports of up to $5.6 billion from the South Asian nation, would impose “hundreds of millions of dollars annually in new taxes” on American companies, the lawmakers said in a bipartisan letter led by Democratic Representative Jim Himes from Connecticut. “In the past, even temporary lapses in such benefits have caused companies to lay off workers, cut salaries and benefits, and delay or cancel job-creating investments in the United States,” the letter says. They urged the administration to continue negotiating a deal with India that would protect American jobs.     A decision to scrap the trade privilege comes as President Donald Trump has vowed to cut the U.S. trade deficit and repeatedly called out India for high tariffs.      India is the world’s largest beneficiary of GSP, which dates from the 1970s, and ending its participation would not only be the strongest punitive action against the country since Trump took office, but would also open a new front in the global trade war.     The elimination of GSP is likely to bring retaliatory tariffs from New Delhi, according to a senior source with direct knowledge of the matter.      Last June, India said it would step up import duties varying from 20 percent to 120 percent on a slew of U.S. farm, steel and iron products, angered by Washington’s refusal to exempt it from new steel and aluminum tariffs.    But it has since repeatedly delayed adopting the higher duties - a move that could be implemented if GSP is withdrawn, the source added.     India is hoping the decision to end the trade privilege is delayed and the Trump administration is open to further negotiations, the source said.     In April, Republican Senator John Cornyn and Democratic Senator Mark Warner, co-chairs of the Senate India caucus, urged Lighthizer to delay adopting the plan.     India sent a trade package listing the concessions it was willing to make to the USTR in late February but hasn’t heard from them, the source said.     “They are usually very responsive so it is highly unusual for them to not respond to the trade package that was sent,” the source said.     The decision to drop GSP is also ill-timed as it comes in the middle of elections in India, hampering the country’s ability to negotiate further, the source added.     Despite close political ties between the two countries, trade between India and the United States, which stood at $126 billion in 2017, is widely seen to be performing at nearly a quarter of its potential.     Trade relations suffered in the past few months after India adopted new rules on e-commerce, reining in how U.S. companies such as Amazon.com Inc and Walmart Inc can do business in the country.

19215,"Discussing three-way nuclear deal with Russia, China: Trump",US President Donald Trump said that he discussed a three-way nuclear deal involving Russia and China during a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday. Trump also discussed with Putin the issue of getting North Korea to dismantle its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programmes. The US and Russia recently withdrew from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty.,Reuters,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said he and Russian President Vladimir Putin discussed on Friday the possibility of a new accord limiting nuclear arms that could eventually include China in what would be a major deal between the globe’s top three atomic powers. Trump, speaking to reporters as he met in the Oval Office with Peter Pellegrini, prime minister of the Slovak Republic, also said he and Putin discussed efforts to persuade North Korea to give up nuclear weapons, the political discord in Venezuela, and Ukraine during a call that stretched over an hour. The 2011 New START treaty, the only U.S.-Russia arms control pact limiting deployed strategic nuclear weapons, expires in February 2021 but can be extended for five years if both sides agree. Without the agreement, it could be harder to gauge each other’s intentions, arms control advocates say. Trump cited the expense of keeping up the U.S. nuclear arsenal as a motivating factor behind wanting to limit how many weapons are deployed. “We’re talking about a nuclear agreement where we make less and they make less and maybe where we get rid of some of the tremendous firepower that we have right now,” he said. Trump said China during trade talks had “felt very strongly” about joining the United States and Russia in limiting nuclear weapons. “So I think we’re going to probably start up something very shortly between Russia and ourselves maybe to start off, and I think China will be added down the road. We’ll be talking about non-proliferation, we’ll be talking about a nuclear deal of some kind, and I think it’ll be a very comprehensive one,” he said. The New START treaty required the United States and Russia to cut their deployed strategic nuclear warheads to no more than 1,550, the lowest level in decades, and limit delivery systems - land- and submarine-based missiles and nuclear-capable bombers. It also includes extensive transparency measures requiring each side to allow the other to carry out 10 inspections of strategic nuclear bases each year; give 48 hours notice before new missiles covered by the treaty leave their factories; and provide notifications before ballistic missile launches. Trump has called the New START treaty concluded by his predecessor, Barack Obama, a “bad deal” and “one-sided.” The Kremlin said the two sides confirmed they intended to “activate dialogue in various spheres, including strategic security.” The two men, who last chatted informally at a dinner of world leaders in Buenos Aires on Dec. 1, briefly talked about the report by U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller that concluded Trump did not collude with Russia during his 2016 presidential campaign. Putin seemed amused, said Trump. “He said something to the effect that it started off as a mountain, and it ended up being a mouse. But he knew that because he knew there was no collusion whatsoever. Pretty much that’s what it was,” he said. The Kremlin said the call was initiated by Washington. It said the two leaders agreed to maintain contacts on different levels and expressed satisfaction with the “businesslike and constructive nature” of the conversation. With the United States concerned about a Russian military presence in Venezuela at a time when Washington wants Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro to leave power, Trump told Putin “the United States stands with the people of Venezuela” and stressed he wanted to get relief supplies into the country, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said. Putin told Trump that any external interference in Venezuela’s internal business undermines the prospects of a political end to the crisis, the Kremlin said. The two leaders discussed Ukraine. Trump cancelled a summit meeting with Putin late last year after Russia seized three Ukrainian Navy ships on Nov. 25 and arrested 24 sailors. Putin also told Trump that the new leadership in Ukraine should take steps to solve the Ukrainian crisis, the Kremlin said. Trump also raised with Putin the issue of getting North Korea to dismantle its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs. Trump has met twice with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un but Kim has yet to agree to a disarmament deal. Sanders said Trump mentioned several times “the need and importance of Russia stepping up and continuing to put pressure on North Korea to denuclearize.” The Kremlin said both leaders highlighted the need to pursue denuclearisation of the region. During an April summit with Kim in Vladivostok, Putin expressed Russian support for a gradual process of trading disarmament for sanctions relief.

19222,17-yr-old finds bug in Dell PCs that exposed them to hacking,"Dell has acknowledged a vulnerability on its pre-installed SupportAssist tool, reported by 17-year-old security researcher Bill Demirkapi, that exposed its laptops and computers to remote hacking. The bug allowed hackers on the same local network as their victim to install malicious software on PCs, if they visited a website controlled by the attacker. Dell provided a fix on April 23.",Engadget,"In another example of a problem that is sadly familiar, Bill Demirkapi found a vulnerability in the support software that Dell installs on most of its new PCs. His method tricks the SupportAssist software -- intended as a way to easily update drivers, adjust settings and clean out unused files -- into allowing an attacker to remotely install malware. It's worth noting however, that it would require an attacker being on the same local network as their victim and have the victim view a website controlled by the attacker.The write up of the issue explains how it works and his process for finding the flaw after replacing his old MacBook Pro with a Dell G3 gaming laptop. It also details his timeline from finding the issue in October until Dell was able to address it earlier this year. At this point, owners of Dell PCs running Windows should check to see if they have SupportAssist installed, and if so, make sure it has been updated to version 3.2.0.90 or higher (the current latest version is 3.2.1).

The around 44-year-old cricketer had said that Gambhir has ""attitude problem"" and ""no personality"".",CricTracker,"The former Pakistan cricketer Shahid Afridi’s autobiography has added another nail in the Gauti-Afridi rivalry. The book, named, “Game Changer” was released on 30th April and has been in the limelight ever since then. The former Pakistan skipper has made some shocking revelations in the book regarding different affairs of his cricketing career.Afridi had opined on several matters like his actual age, the atmosphere of the Pakistan dressing room during the early days of his career, the fights between him and his other teammates like Waqar Younis, etc. Another incident, about which the 44-year old, opened up a bit was his conflict with the former Indian cricketer Gautam Gambhir.AdvertisementThe antagonism between the two had started way back in 2007 when the exchange of some verbal volleys had resulted in a heated argument. However, this wasn’t limited as 13 years down the lane, the two veterans are still vying for their superiority.Shahid Afridi, in his book, had written some disrespectful quotes towards Gambhir. The Khyber-born, in his autobiography, mentioned, “Gambhir behaves like he’s a cross between Don Bradman & James Bond. In Karachi, we call guys like him saryal (burnt up). It’s simple, I like happy, positive people. Doesn’t matter if they are aggressive or competitive, but you have to be positive & Gambhir wasn’t.”Meanwhile, Gautam Gambhir too gave a fitting reply to Shahid Afridi for his uncivil thoughts. The Delhi-born, who took retirement from all forms of the game a few months ago, took on Shahid Afridi with all his guns blazing. As a reply to his counterpart’s impudent comments, the 37-year old posted a tweet on his official twitter handle where he advised Afridi, to visit a psychiatrist. The former Kolkata Knight Riders skipper termed him “hilarious” and invited him to India, for check-up.“@SAfridiOfficial you are a hilarious man!!!

19228,Never imagined I'd get Best Actress award at my age: Neena,"Neena Gupta, who recently won the Filmfare Critics' Best Actress award for her performance in 'Badhaai Ho', said that she could never have imagined winning the award at her age. ""[T]he last two years have seen a major change in Indian cinema,"" the 59-year-old actress added. ""This is a very good sign...especially for us actors,"" Neena further said.",Times Now,"Gone are the days when stories solely revolving around youth, their romance, revenge, and lives found their way to the screen. In the past few years, the Indian film industry has witnessed a major shift in terms of content. While filmmakers and viewers alike are craving for more content-rich stories and substantial cinema, a handful of them are also breaking the mold and bringing to screen the stories of the age group that didn't quite find its lead representation on celluloid, the older middle-class couple. Veteran actor Neena Gupta has cast a spell with her recent choices including Amit Sharma's Badhaai Ho co-starring Gajraj Rao and Ayushmann Khurrana, in which she essayed the role of Priyamvada Kaushik, a housewife who embraces an unplanned pregnancy at a later stage in her life. Sharing that it's a “golden period of Indian cinema”, Gupta in interaction with ZoomTV.com explained the rise in these stories. She said, “I feel that the last two years have seen a major change in Indian cinema. A lot of new kind of stories and subjects are being made. Plus, many small and medium-sized films have been done. And because these films are becoming a hit with the audience, so more and more writers are writing this and financers are financing this.”Gupta elaborated, “This is a very good sign and especially for us actors. I could never have imagined that I would get the best actor award at my age for Badhaai Ho. I have been getting more offers for these kinds of films and not just films that have big star cast, action, but the other kind of stories that weren't being made earlier. It's a good sign.”
In an earlier interview, Gajraj Rao, who played Mr. Kaushik in the film, had opened up about the same, sharing that the credit goes to Bollywood's lead actors also, who are ready to star in such films. “Large part of the credit goes to Ayushmann because he agreed to do a film wherein, not just a hero but every other character was of paramount importance too,” he had said. Sanjay Mishra, who played the role of Yashwant Batra, a man who doesn't quite believe in expressing his love to his wife and then decides to go all romantic to woo back her wife in Harish Vyas' Angrezi Mein Kehte Hai, is of the view that viewers now demand content that is closer to reality, and not just dramatic per se. “Someone once asked me that why do love stories on screen happen only with Punjabi people or the youth and why not with old age people. So, I am glad that filmmakers are now understanding the need for these stories,” he shared. 
Both Mishra and Gupta, who have now united for Gwalior, a thriller drama based on an older couple and how their life changes after “something happens” couldn't be happier with the roles, scripts, and stories coming their way currently. “These days, people are liking general stories, not the drama-centric ones. They want something they can relate to and we need something real to showcase. The time has changed now, and so has the pattern of writing stories too. 20 years ago, no one was giving me roles like this,” exclaimed Mishra. Gupta added, “Earlier, there was no choice. People at my age, men still have a lot of other roles, but women had very few roles where we just played mother to the hero, there was nothing substantial to the role.”Gupta pointed out that it's also because of the rise of digital platforms that filmmakers and actors have more freedom to experiment with content. “A lot of people can make small budget films and they don't have to worry about the release and spend money on the same. With digital platforms, another avenue has opened up. A person like me can choose now. Otherwise, whatever came to us, we had to do that because there was nothing much. I think it's a golden period of Indian cinema. It will become even better and thank god, I am still there that I can be a part of it.”

Travelling regularly with the players for national competitions – often insisting on sharing a bed with them – Stephen would wait until the middle of the night to fondle and photograph his sleeping victims.One photo showed Stephen next to a boy sleeping on a bed. Holding the camera at arm’s length in one hand, he held the boy’s penis in his other ‘positioning it inches from his mouth’.The victim later recalled Stephen had given him medication that night that made him drowsy.Stephen posed online as girls to trick the boys into sending sexual images of themselves. He also took pictures of the boys as they slept during tripsThe image was just one of several thousand stored on the hidden hard drive that was turned in police in February 2018.It contained more than 400 folders, listed alphabetically by the victim’s last name, varying anywhere from two images to 100 of each boy.These images included secret recordings of boys in bathrooms, hotel rooms, and changing in one of Stephen’s two properties.At least 15 of the 440 counts of abuse Stephen was prosecuted with were ‘hands on’, prosecutors said.Between 1999 and 2018, multiple victims accused Stephen of sharing a hotel bed with them during basketball trips and awaking in the middle of the night to find him masturbating their genitals at the same time as his.Speaking to the Des Moines Register last year, one student told the outlet Stephen had masturbated next to him in a Las Vegas hotel room, but he was too scared to report it through fear of jeopardizing his college basketball aspirations.‘I was so young,’ he said. ‘I feel like that’s what his power was against us – we were so young.’Prosecutors agreed, remarking that Stephen used the Barnstormers as a ‘steady, replenishing stream of victims’.Mothers of two of the victims urged the judge to impart a life sentence on Stephen, who also help manage his family’s car dealership in Monticello.‘He believed you held the keys to the basketball kingdom,’ said the mother of one boy, who was tricked by Stephen into sending videos of himself masturbating. ‘My son trusted you and you destroyed that. … How dare you use basketball for your selfish, despicable, disgusting, self-seeking motivation.’At least 15 of the 440 counts of abuse Stephen was prosecuted with were ‘hands on’, prosecutors saidOn the contrary, the coach’s attorneys sought leniency in his sentencing, hoping to secure a term of 20 years followed by intensive supervision upon his release.Defense lawyers argued that Stephen was a voyeur and not a serial molester, meaning his urges are controllable and he was a low risk for re-offending now he’d been reprimanded.‘He’s not a threat to society,’ his father added.Stephen addressed family members of his victims in the courtroom, saying the he was ‘disgusted. The things I have done are repulsive and wrong.’He added that his greatest regret was that his coaching success stories had now been forever tarnished – an outburst rebuked by the judge, who insisted his regret should be for the harm he caused his victims and their families.Stephen co-founded the Barnstormers, an elite Basketball team who competed nationally and were sponsored by AdidasStephen’s two decades of vile sexual abuse and exploitation was finally unearthed in February last year, when his brother-in-law discovered a secret recording device during renovation work in the coach’s home.Among the thousands of images of his players and their friends, an additional file titled ‘vault’ was also found among the hard drive, containing thousands more images of unnamed young boys.Stephen, who has been in jail since his arrest last year, pleaded guilty to multiple charges of child sexual exploitation and production of child pornography.It’s believed he will seek to appeal his conviction and sentence, claiming the seizure of the recording device violated his privacy rights.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6989031/Former-youth-basketball-coach-Iowa-accused-abusing-440-boys-two-decades-gets-180-YEARS.html?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

Trump met with Slovak Prime Minister Peter Pellegrini in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, DC FridayLast month Pyongyang said it was testing a 'tactical guided weapon' conducted in 'various modes of firing at different targets'. They demanded that Washington remove Secretary of State Mike Pompeo from nuclear negotiations.Pompeo and South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha agreed to 'cautiously respond' to the latest firing and to continue communications during a phone call on Saturday, South Korea's foreign ministry said in a statement.Pompeo also held talks with Japan's Foreign Minister Taro Kono, and agreed, together with South Korea, to cooperate and share information, the Japanese Foreign Ministry said.North Korea has claimed to have ballistic missiles that could reach the US mainland. The country also says it has developed a nuclear bomb small enough to fit on a long-range missile.  People watch a TV showing a file footage of North Korea's missile launch during a news program at the Seoul Railway Station in Seoul, South Korea, SaturdayJapan's Defense Ministry said at this point Japan does not face a situation that would pose any immediate risk to its national security. In Tokyo people walk past a screen showing a TV news on unidentified short-range projectiles fired by North KoreaAs the projectiles were launched it was still Friday in the US when Trump hosted reporters during his meeting with Slovak Prime Minister Peter Pellegrini in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, DC. North Korea's vice foreign minister said on Tuesday the United States will face 'undesired consequences' if it fails to present a new position in denuclearization talks by the end of the year.During a summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in late April, North Korea's Kim said that peace and security on the Korean peninsula depended on the United States, warning that a state of hostility could easily return, according to North Korean media.'The North wanted to deliver a message on security guarantees to Washington through the mouth of Putin, but the summit fell short of driving change in the U.S. attitude, leading the North to take stronger action today,' said Hong Min, a senior researcher of Korea Institute for National Unification.Trump raised the issue of North Korea during a telephone call with Putin on Friday. Sanders said Trump told Putin several times 'the need and importance of Russia stepping up and continuing to put pressure on North Korea to denuclearize.'Japan's Defense Ministry said North Korean missiles have not reached in or around Japan's territory or its 200-nautical-mile (320-kilometer) exclusive economic zone'With North Korea never promising to completely stop all missile testing - it only promised a self-imposed moratorium of testing long-range missiles such as ICBMs that can hit the US homeland - we should not be shocked by North Korea's short-range launch,' Korean studies director at the Washington-based Center for the National Interest, Harry J. Kazianis, said. 'Clearly, Pyongyang is frustrated with the conclusion of the recent summit with Washington in Vietnam that did not produce any breakthrough. It also seems clear that North Korea is angry over what appears to be a lack of flexibility in the Trump Administration's position on relieving sanctions, sticking to a policy of 'maximum pressure'.' Experts believe that the North has viable shorter range nuclear armed missiles but still needs more tests to perfect its longer-range weapons.In this April 18, 2019 photo, a mock North Korea's Scud-B missile, center, and South Korean missiles are displayed at Korea War Memorial Museum in Seoul, South KoreaNorth Korea said last month it had test-fired a new type of 'tactical guided weapon' and demanded Washington remove Secretary of State Mike Pompeo from nuclear negotiations. Pictured above, visitors watch a photo showing North Korea's missile launch at the Unification Observation Post in Paju, South Korea on April 19During the diplomacy that followed a rocky 2017, Kim Jong Un said that the North would not test nuclear devices or ICBMs.However satellite images last month indicated radioactive material could be being turned into bomb fuel.A short-range missile would not violate that self-imposed moratorium. It may instead be a way to register his displeasure with Washington and the state of talks meant to provide sanctions relief for disarmament without having the diplomacy collapse.This satellite image captured on February 22, shows Sanumdong research center on the outskirts of Pyongyang.

""[T]hat's a wake-up call...to work harder and chose better,"" Arjun further said.",Times Now,"Bollywood actor Arjun Kapoor has time and again impressed the audience with his acting in several Bollywood movies including Half Girlfriend, Namaste England, Tevar and many more. The actor is set to amaze the audience once again with his upcoming film India's Most Wanted. Helmed by Raj Kumar, the film has been making headlines since its inception and is reportedly based on the story of five infamous heroes who plan to capture terrorists without using a single bullet. In it, Arjun will be seen essaying the role Prabhat Singh and will share screen space with actors including Rajesh Sharma, Shantilal Mukherjee, and Prashanth Alexander.In a recent interview, Arjun was seen talking about how the industry is full of highs and lows. Calling himself an ""underdog"", the actor was quoted by Mid-Day as saying, ""Some choices do go wrong but you live and learn. I want to do good work. I am happy when fans believe in me. But without taking advantage of the situation, I have always considered myself as an underdog."" Arjun, who made his acting debut with Ishaqzaade opened up about his debut film and further added, ""The audience appreciated and accepted me. I am here today because they pay money to watch our films, sometimes they don't and that happens to the best of us.

They come with the selfless pursuit of rising beyond the ordinary to protect their nation - their only home. They come with the gumption to guard what is theirs.""He further wrote, “They are satisfied being one in many, in not being heralded as the saviours, in disappearing into the milieu of everyday life so that they can go back to doing their jobs of protecting us. Because nothing is bigger to them than the pride they take in walking to work every day, knowing that this might be their last day alive. Knowing that no one will ever know about them. Knowing that they are the uncelebrated, the undiscussed, the unsung heroes. They are the ones who have served our country undeterred by failure and death, the ones we owe many historic moments of national pride to. They are the ones who have chosen to stay unknown. I salute you - and I am humbled to play one of you. This is a tribute to your relentless spirit.

19273,"Tesla seeks to raise $2.7 bn, Musk to buy stock worth $25 mn","Electric carmaker Tesla is selling 3.1 million shares at a price of $243 per share, up from the previous 2.7 million announced on Thursday, seeking to raise up to $2.7 billion, regulatory filings revealed. Tesla's billionaire Co-founder and CEO Elon Musk also plans to buy stock worth $25 million. Musk currently holds a 20% stake in the $42-billion company.",Reuters,"(Reuters) - Tesla Inc on Friday was set to raise up to $2.7 billion in a record-setting capital raising for the electric carmaker, as investors scooped up a mix of new stock and convertible notes that will recharge the company’s cash-depleted balance sheet. The company said in a filing that it had increased its offer to 3.1 million shares, rising to 3.5 million including a tranche for underwriting banks, from an initially planned 2.7 million, priced at $243 per share. The filing also showed it would place convertible debt worth $1.6 billion, up from an initial planned $1.35 billion. That all pointed to buoyant interest in the offering and shares in the company rose 2.5 percent in morning trading.  The coupon for the debt offering, however, was set at 2.0 percent - the top of the indicated range - suggesting the company had ceded ground to investors to borrow so much.  The conversion premium at which the bonds can be exchanged for stock in the future, was also at the bottom of the initial range given by the company - another concession.  “Seeing the offering amount raised does not surprise me at all,” Clement Thibault, senior analyst at global financial markets platform Investing.com.  “As far as Tesla is concerned, the more money in the bank, the better.” Tesla’s launch of a capital raise was greeted with relief by Wall Street on Thursday after a tumultuous year which has seen analysts and investors cast doubt on its ability to produce, sell and deliver enough cars to make a sustainable profit. The company faces expensive challenges, including launching production in China, overhauling its U.S. retail and service operations and developing new models, including the high-volume Model Y SUV and a Semi commercial truck. Many analysts had calculated that without new cash Tesla - which burned through $1.5 billion in the first quarter and has seen demand for its cars soften - would not be able to carry out its plans. The company said that after all costs had been deducted it could now get up to $2.7 billion in new capital from the offer. That compared to the $2.2 billion in cash reserves the company held at the end of March.  Billionaire Musk, whose fortune centers around a 20 percent stake in the $42-billion company, also doubled his initial commitment for buying shares and will now buy stock worth up to $25 million, the company said. “The fact that Musk could increase its share from $10 million to $25 million is in line with the usual marketing scheme,” said Nord LB analyst Frank Schwope. “Musk always tries to surprise with promises that are often not kept.”   Including the option for underwriters to buy 15 percent in each offering, Tesla will sell about $860 million in new shares and $1.84 billion in debt. Tesla had said on Thursday it would raise up to $2.3 billion in new capital through shares and debt. That included an offering of 2.7 billion shares worth around $650 million and $1.35 billion in debt, before issues to underwriters. Tesla’s junk and convertible bonds opened roughly unchanged from Thursday’s close, with the bonds of its SolarCity unit higher, according to Refinitiv data. The $1.8 billion junk bond maturing in 2025 < 88160RAE1=>, which rose 1.8% Thursday to a high of 87 cents on the dollar, was last at 86.5 cents.

19290,Unemployment rate in US reaches 49-year low at 3.6%,"The unemployment rate in the US has reached 3.6%, dropping to its lowest level in more than 49 years, figures released by the US' Labour Department showed. The US added 2.63 lakh jobs in April, with the professional and business services witnessing the highest increase in payroll. Average earnings in the US grew at an annual rate of 3.2%.",Reuters,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. job growth surged in April and the unemployment rate dropped to the lowest in nearly half a century, pointing to sustained strength in economic activity even as last year’s massive stimulus from Republican tax cuts and spending increases fades. The Labor Department’s closely watched monthly employment report on Friday showed the greater-than-expected 263,000 new jobs created last month were spread across most industry sectors, and the unemployment rate was just 3.6%, the lowest since December 1969.  Still, wage gains did not accelerate as expected, holding at  a reading that is consistent with moderate inflation. Moreover, the decline in the unemployment rate was driven largely by the   most people leaving the labor force in a year and a half.  The report was supportive of the Federal Reserve’s decision on Wednesday to keep interest rates unchanged and signal little desire to adjust monetary policy anytime soon. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell described the economy and job growth as “a bit stronger than we anticipated” and inflation “somewhat weaker.” “Employment gains are strong enough to dispel any immediate concerns over the health of the economy, while wage gains are not strong enough to force the Federal Reserve’s hand to tighten the policy stance,” said Harm Bandholz, chief U.S. economist at UniCredit Research in New York. Aside from April’s surge in nonfarm payrolls, the economy created 16,000 more jobs in February and March than previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls rising by 185,000 jobs last month. The strong economy, especially the labor market, could boost President Donald Trump’s re-election hopes next year. Trump, who  has boasted about the economy being one of the major wins of his first term in office, cheered April’s robust employment gains. “JOBS, JOBS, JOBS,” Trump tweeted. The economy will mark 10 years of expansion in July, the longest on record. Job gains are well above the roughly 100,000 needed per month to keep up with growth in the working-age population. The second month of strong employment growth put to rest concerns about a recession and ironically undercut Trump’s call for the Fed to cut interest rates. A brief inversion of the U.S. Treasury yield curve in March had fanned fears of an economic downturn, leading markets to price in a rate cut this year. “It would be awfully hard for the Fed to explain a rate cut given the strong job market, so forget that,” said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania.  Hiring remains strong, despite anecdotal evidence of worker shortages in the transportation, manufacturing and construction industries, suggesting there is still some spare capacity in the labor market.  Steadily rising wages had until recently been keeping workers in the labor force and drawing back some who had dropped out. Average hourly earnings rose 6 cents, or 0.2% in April after rising by the same margin in March. That kept the annual increase in wages at 3.2% for a second straight month. Though wage growth is not strong enough to drive up inflation, it is seen sufficient to underpin economic growth as the stimulus from last year’s $1.5 trillion tax cut wanes. The economy grew at a 3.2% annualized rate in the first quarter, driven by a surge in exports and inventories, quickening from the October-December period’s 2.2% pace. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies, while  U.S. Treasury prices rose. Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher. Despite April’s robust job gains, there are signs the economy slowed early in the second quarter.  A survey from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) on Friday showed a measure of services industry activity dropped to a 20-month low in April. It followed on the heels of another ISM survey this week showing factory activity hitting a 2-1/2-year low last month.          Last month’s two-tenths of a percentage point drop in the  unemployment rate from 3.8 % in March was because 490,000 people left the labor force in April, the most in 18 months. It was the fourth straight month of workers dropping out of the labor force and could shrink the pool of available workers. The labor force participation rate, or the proportion of working-age Americans who have a job or are looking for one, fell to 62.8% in April from 63.0% in March.  This suggested more slack in the labor market than indicated by the unemployment rate. The drop in participation was almost across the board, with significant declines among prime-age and younger workers. “The supply side of the economy looks a little less shiny in light of the decline in the participation rate,” said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan in New York.  A broader measure of unemployment, which includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part-time because they cannot find full-time employment, was unchanged at 7.3% in April. Economists expect job growth will slow this year as fewer workers become available, which will push up wages and lift inflation back to the Fed’s 2% target. An inflation measure tracked by the U.S. central bank increased 1.6% in the year to March, the smallest gain in 14 months. Employment at construction sites increased by 33,000 jobs in April, rising for a second straight month. Manufacturing sector payrolls rebounded by 4,000 jobs after being unchanged in March. The industry is being pressured by layoffs in the automobile sector as assembly plants try to cope with declining sales and an inventory overhang. The auto sector shed jobs for a fourth straight month. Employment increased in the leisure and hospitality, professional and business services, healthcare, transportation and warehousing, and financial activities industries. But retail payrolls declined for a third straight month.  Temporary help, a harbinger for future hiring, rebounded last month after dropping in March. Government payrolls increased by 27,000 in April.

Rose said in a statement Facebook has not responded and the other firms did not fully or directly answer his questions.

19302,SoftBank planning IPO of $100-billion Vision Fund: WSJ,"Masayoshi Son-led Japanese multinational conglomerate SoftBank Group is planning an Initial Public Offering (IPO) of its $100-billion Vision Fund, the Wall Street Journal reported. It is also reportedly in talks with Oman to raise funds. The company has publicly stated it plans to set up a second investment fund, reportedly of at least the same size as its Vision Fund.",Reuters,"(Reuters) - Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp is considering an initial public offering of its $100 billion Vision Fund, a source familiar with the matter said on Friday. The fund was set up in 2017 and has become the world’s largest technology investment fund. Its investments include ride-hailing pioneer Uber, chip designer ARM and shared workspace firm WeWork. The company has publicly stated it plans to set up a second investment fund. The senior banking source said Softbank was now talking to banks about helping it raise money, confirming an earlier report in the Wall Street Journal. Softbank has spoken to half a dozen banks over the last month about a potential listing of the Vision Fund but has yet to start a formal process, the source said, adding he was not expecting such a process in the near term. “They asked banks questions on how they could possibly do it. It is still very much in exploration mode,” the source said, adding that Softbank had been possibly given the idea by fellow tech investor Naspers, which plans to list some of its assets. “The big difference is that the biggest asset in the Naspers portfolio is Tencent, which is listed, whereas the portfolio of the Vision Fund is all private,” the source said. China’s Tencent Holdings Ltd is a social media and gaming company listed in Hong Kong. A spokesman for Softbank declined to comment when contacted by Reuters. SoftBank is also in talks with Oman for an investment in the fund, which has raised nearly all of its funding so far from Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi, according to the WSJ report. Oman was not immediately available for a comment when contacted by Reuters, nor was there an immediate response from the Japanese conglomerate.      SoftBank is seeking to raise new funds for “informal deals” chief executive officer Masayoshi Son negotiated in China for Vision Fund, one of the people told WSJ. The fund is also planning to double its staff over the next 18 months to keep up with the pace of deal making by SoftBank, the company’s top deputies reportedly said at a conference in Los Angeles this week.

According to official records, Afridi scored the century aged 16 years and 217 days. Afridi, in his book, revealed he was born in 1975 and not 1980.",CricTracker,"Shahid Afridi has made some startling revelations in his autobiography ‘Game Changer’. One of them which is making headlines is his age. Afridi himself has revealed that he wasn’t 16 years old when he hit the century in the ODI format back in October 1996 on his debut. The game was against Sri Lanka which was played at the Gymkhana Club Ground in Nairobi.In his book, Afridi has clearly stated that he was born in 1975 and not in 1980. According to that, he should be currently 44 years old and the record of the youngest to score a century shouldn’t belong to him. Afridi has, moreover, claimed that he was 19 years old when he scored the famous century and not sixteen which has confused a lot of people.Advertisement“Also, for the record, I was just nineteen, and not sixteen like they claim. I was born in 1975. So, yes, the authorities stated my age incorrectly,” the statement from the book read.Ever since Shahid Afridi has revealed his real age in his autobiography, the video showing his 37-ball ton is going viral. The fans are going through it yet again to confirm and a shocking thing has come up in the process. The broadcaster of the series played in Nairobi when the former Pakistan cricketer slammed a century, had shown his age as 21.Many are perplexed now with the fact that how did he manage to become the youngest to score a century then? If the broadcasters had displayed the age correctly, then why and when was the age changed? Well, a lot of questions are surfacing regarding the matter and only Afridi can answer those. Moreover, his claim of scoring a century while he was 19 is confusing.Now it remains to be seen if any action is taken officially on the cricketer or it will remain only a matter of gossip for a few days.",https://www.crictracker.com/broadcasters-had-rightly-displayed-shahid-afridis-age-as-21-not-16-during-his-debut-odi-innings/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
19309,Billionaire Elon Musk personally owes $507 million to banks,"Tesla's billionaire CEO Elon Musk personally owes $507 million to three banks involved in the carmaker's stock and debt sale, a company filing showed. Musk has pledged about 13 million of his Tesla shares, which represent about 40% of his holdings, as collateral for personal debts. Those pledged shares have a value of about $4 billion at today's share price.",Reuters,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Tesla Inc Chief Executive Elon Musk personally owes $507 million to Wall Street banks involved in Tesla’s stock and debt sale, backed by his stake in the electric car maker, a company filing showed on Thursday. The lending was disclosed in Tesla’s prospectus on Thursday to raise up to $2.3 billion with new shares and convertible debt, and it was $117 million less than the personal loans to Musk disclosed in Tesla’s previous prospectus in 2017.  Still, Tesla said that if the price of its stock falls and the banks force Musk to sell some of his shares, that could create additional pressure on the stock. Tesla jumped over 4% after Tesla disclosed capital raising plans, which soothed investors’ recent concerns about the Palo Alto, California company and pulled its stock up from two-year lows.  Musk, who owns 20% of Tesla, has taken personal loans from Wall Street banks for years. A Tesla 2017 prospectus showed $624 million in loans to Musk. The filing on Thursday showed Musk owed money to three banks working on the capital increase.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc has $213 million in loans outstanding to Musk, while he owes Morgan Stanley $209 million, and another $85 million to Bank of America Corp . Goldman was not mentioned as a personal lender to Musk in the 2017 filing.  Those loans are backed by Musk’s shares in Tesla, currently worth a total of around $8 billion. If Tesla’s stock declines, then Musk could be forced to sell some of those shares under terms of the loan, according to the Tesla filing. Mark Williams, a professor of finance at Boston University, said that investment banks can run into conflicts of interest with their deals with companies, their founders and CEOs, testing their rules to keep different businesses separate. “This is particularly true in the case of Tesla where you have an aggressive and vocal CEO who is prone to pushing the legal limits and gain terms that might run counter to Goldman’s conflict of interest policies,” Williams said. Goldman and Citigroup Inc, the top-line book runners in Thursday’s capital raise, both have “sell” ratings on Tesla’s stock, which is unusual but not exceptional on Wall Street. At the end of 2018, Musk and his trust had 13.4 million Tesla shares pledged as collateral for personal debts, according to another filing. That is down from 13.8 million shares at the end of 2017. Tesla, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs declined to talk about the loans. Tesla has a policy that caps executives’ borrowings at a quarter of the value of the shares pledged as collateral. With Tesla repeatedly pushing back forecasts for turning a profit, its stock has dropped 27% year to date. Musk plans to buy another $10 million worth of shares as part of the sale announced on Thursday.

It simply can't provide the jobs that need to be provided for the young people who are entering the labour force. The education system is literally broken. I went to Pakistan more often than I went to any other country when I was deputy director,"" he said, referring to his impression about Pakistan when he was the deputy head in the CIA during the Obama administration.There's no wonder that many Pakistani parents send their kids to madrasa and one knows what happens to a small percentage of the kids who go there. ""The extremism is growing from a societal perspective. It's growing within the military. So, it is not impossible, not tomorrow, not next week, not next year, but five years from now, 10 years from now that you could have a color revolution, Arab spring style movement in the streets of Islamabad that ends up with an extremist government there with nuclear weapons. That's what so scary,"" Morell said.According to Morell, then president Barack Obama's Pakistan policy in his first term was to get the Pakistanis to see their strategic environment in a real way. ""They still see India and, I think, for foreseeable future, will see India as an existential threat to the state of Pakistan. It's not, it's just not. India stopped focusing on Pakistan a long time ago. They're focusing on their economic future,"" he argued.""But because the Pakistanis are so obsessed with this perceived existential threat, they've both organised their society in order to protect themselves from that threat. So, they've given an immense amount of power to the military, and much less power to the civilian government.The government therefore makes choices that I don't believe, and many people don't believe are in the best long term interest of Pakistan,"" he said.Pakistan has spent more money on nuclear weapons than they do in education. ""And they use terrorism as a tool against the Indians and then also in Afghanistan, because they fear Indian influence in Afghanistan. So they've created terrorist groups, right to be a tool of theirs in the struggle against India,"" Morell added.On Wednesday, Pakistan-based terror group Jaish-e-Mohammed's chief Masood Azhar, who is responsible for carrying out terror attacks in India, was designated as a global terrorist by the UN.",http://www.newindianexpress.com/world/2019/may/03/pakistan-uses-terrorism-as-tool-against-india-former-cia-director-1972168.html?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

I don't want to be Ronaldo or Messi, I want to be myself."" ""I just want to shine with Chelsea, to help us finish in the top four and to try to win the Europa League,"" Hazard added.",Times Now,"Chelsea forward Eden Hazard is unarguably one of the finest players in world football. He even made it to the Premier League Player of the Year shortlist, before seeing Liverpool's Virgil van Dijk being crowned as the winner. While Hazard has produced many match-winning performances for club and country, he still isn't seen in the same category of Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi. Although the Belgian does aim to become the best player in the world, he said that he doesn't want to be Messi or Ronaldo.In an interview with Times of India, Hazard spoke about various aspects of the game, ranging from Chelsea's UEFA Champions League qualification hopes to his highly talked about transfer rumour to Real Madrid. While the attacker refused to get into the details in revealing what the future holds for him, he did admit that helping the Blues bag a UCL spot remains one of his top priorities.“It’s very important,” said Hazard when asked about the importance of being in the UCL next season. “Chelsea has to play in the Champions League every year, it's one of biggest clubs in the world, and for myself also I want to play in the Champions League. And I think we will.”A transfer from Chelsea has been on the cards for Hazard for a couple of seasons but the Belgian has stayed put at the Stamford Bridge club during these years. Entering the final year of his contract, Hazard is highly linked with a move to Spain with Real Madrid but when asked whether this is going to be his last season in London, the 28-year-old remained tight-lipped.“I’m not thinking about that now at all. I just want to shine with Chelsea, to help us finish in the top four and to try to win the Europa League. That’s the only focus,” he said.There still remains many areas of the game where Hazard can develop himself and possibly reach the levels of Messi and Ronaldo. Commenting on the topic, the Belgian said that although he wishes to continue improving, he does not want to become Ronaldo and Messi but himself.“I want to be the best, but it's not what I think about all the time.

19323,"Verizon looking to sell Tumblr, Pornhub interested: Report","American telecoms firm Verizon is looking to sell its microblogging and social networking website Tumblr, the Wall Street Journal reported. Responding to the report, Pornhub VP Corey Price said, ""We're extremely interested in acquiring the platform."" ""[We're] very much looking forward to one day restoring it to its former glory with NSFW (Not Safe for Work) content,"" he added.",TechCrunch,"Tumblr has been squandered ever since it was bought for $1.1 billion in 2013 by Yahoo, now part of Verizon Media  Group. Without proper strategy or talent, the blogging tool and early meme-sharing network fell into decline while Medium and Instagram soared. Yahoo wrote down Tumblr’s value by $230 million in 2016. Then last year, Verizon evicted Tumblr’s huge and loyal base of porn bloggers, leaving no viable platform for independent adult content creators and curators.Now The Wall Street Journal reports that TechCrunch parent company Verizon is considering selling Tumblr.Many immediately hoped it’d change hands to an owner who’d embrace pornography, such as social media darling Pornhub. BuzzFeed quickly reported that Pornhub VP Corey Price told it, “We’re extremely interested in acquiring the platform and are very much looking forward to one day restoring it to its former glory with NSFW content.”But given Pornhub  parent company MindGeek’s record of exploitation of adult performers, that could be a disastrous proceeding for the world of kink.Outside of Pornhub, MindGeek owns many of the top porn streaming sites, like YouPorn, RedTube and GayTube. Widespread piracy of porn films by those sites has made it tough for performers to earn a living. Many smaller studios or performers don’t have the legal or financial resources to file constant copyright infringement takedown notices, and MindGeek’s sites have been accused of allowing re-uploads of videos days after taking them down.The truly insidious part is that MindGeek has also bought up a bunch of the top porn production studios, including Brazzers, Babes.com and Digital Playground. MindGeek has been accused of allowing those studios’ films to be pirated by its own streaming sites. That lets MindGeek earn and keep streaming ad revenue without giving performers a proper cut.The result has been a massive decline in the wages of porn performers and the number of films being made. This is turn pushes performers into more rough and extreme porn genres they’re not comfortable with, or into other sex work like prostitution that can be dangerous. We reached out to Verizon Media Group, which told us “we don’t comment on rumors.” [Update: MindGeek tells TechCrunch it works with Vobile to identify unauthorized content and puts nearly $2 million towards anti-piracy efforts, though that would amount to less than half a percent of the company’s 2015 revenues which have likely grown since then.]“Because there is so much free porn readily available, fewer consumers are willing to purchase any” adult performer Charlotte Sartre tells TechCrunch. “This means less money to the studios and as a direct result, less money to the performers that are hired by those studios . . . Most of us produce our own content, almost everyone has an OnlyFans and/or a Snapchat for fans to subscribe to, and most women in the industry escort, all because paid porn shoots alone are not consistent or lucrative enough to financially sustain performers anymore. It all changed with tube sites and piracy thanks to MindGeek.”If Pornhub and MindGeek succeed in acquiring Tumblr to strengthen their near monopoly, they could end up exploiting porn bloggers and the performers they post about. You could imagine the photos and GIFs in diverse porn genres that populated Tumblr getting scraped and shared across MindGeek’s network of sites beyond the bloggers’ or performers’ control. Or Tumblr’s porn blogs could be used to funnel traffic toward MindGeek’s crooked streaming sites, exacerbating the piracy problem. A more optimistic view would be that Pornhub’s newer features that let performers set up their own paywalls and other monetization channels could help Tumblr curators earn money for themselves… and MindGeek. If Pornhub managed to turn Tumblr around, it would deal a stern lesson to platforms that were quick to ban adult content.Since many of the puritanical U.S. government’s elected officials likely see porn performers as godless heathens undeserving of protection, they’re unlikely to try to safeguard the profession with anti-trust or fair payout regulation. The SESTA-FOSTA law that went into effect last year intending to stop sex trafficking ended up pushing sites like Tumblr, Facebook and Patreon toward tougher crackdowns on porn, nudity or even innocent discussions about sex within support communities for LGTBQ people and other underprivileged minorities.Unfortunately, MindGeek’s massive footprint means it might be willing to bid the highest price for Tumblr. If Verizon does sell Tumblr, it should seek a buyer with an upstanding record for how it treats creators. But Verizon could also modernize Tumblr to emphasize what’s differentiated about it in today’s tech landscape versus when it was founded in 2007. Obviously, it could reopen to porn. But there are also family friendly opportunities.Tumblr was one of the first big meme-sharing communities, even spawning its own format of screenshots of progressively crazier replies to a short text post. Yet in 2019, the top meme networks like Instagram, Reddit and Imgur aren’t actually built for distributing massive “dumps” of memes. They don’t understand which you’ve already seen to prevent showing re-runs, or how remixes of an original meme all relate and should be linked. Tumblr could build meme-specific features that give users more curational power than Reddit and Imgur, but more freedom of expression under less pressure than Instagram.Tumblr could also be repurposed into a “your internet homepage” platform. Most social networks are so desperate to keep users on their apps that they restrict or de-emphasize the ability to promote your other web presences. They also often focus on a narrow set of content types like photos and videos on Instagram. This leaves users who don’t have their own dedicated websites without a central hub where they can freely express their identity and link to profiles elsewhere. This is a huge opportunity for Tumblr, which has already established itself an open-ended self-expression platform open to a variety of content formats.AOL, which was combined with Yahoo to form the Verizon Media Group, previously owned a web profile platform called About.me, but sold it back to its creator Tony Conrad in 2013. Tumblr could assume much of About.me’s functionality as a directory of someone’s presence on other apps, and add that to its blogging platform. Instead of being locked into Instagram and Pinterest’s grids and standardized designs, Tumblr could let people create a homepage collage representing their prismatic identities.Tumblr’s already been waning in popularity for years, so Verizon might not have a lot to lose by giving Tumblr a year to execute on this strategy before selling it for surely much less than it bought it for in 2013. Tumblr’s remaining users deserve better than the platform fading into nothing or being sold to the unscrupulous.If any pornography industry professionals want to weigh in, please contact this article’s author Josh Constine via phone/text or Signal encrypted messenger at (585)750-5674 or joshc ‘at’ techcrunch dot com.",https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/02/porns-secret-monopoly/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

The new feature scans reviews of the restaurant to find commonly-mentioned dish names and adds photos included with those reviews. It can be accessed under a dedicated 'Popular' tab in the 'Menu' page of a restaurant on Google Maps.,Engadget,"Google Maps has long since shown crowdsourced photos of the dishes at listed restaurants, but a new tab will flag up the most popular choices with photos to match.As spotted by Taylor Wimberley on Twitter and confirmed by several other users, the update adds a new tab to the Menu page on a restaurant's Maps listing called Popular Dishes:When did Google Maps get these crowd sourced menu pics? So valuable! pic.twitter.com/hOUOIIfbj9The new feature seems to scan reviews of the restaurant to find commonly-mentioned dish names, then adds photos included with those reviews to the Popular tab. Whether this is done automatically or humans are involved is currently unclear, but a fully automated system would presumably make mistakes whereby someone's review mentioned one dish and the photo showed another. That said, Google does have extensive image-recognition tech (as seen in Google Photos, for instance) which could be used here.9to5Google notes that while you can suggest edits to the information shown, as with anything on Maps, several dishes don't have names because the person posting them didn't include a caption. That's not so helpful when customers spot something delicious and want to order it, but they could always show the photo to the waitstaff.The update to Maps has only been rolled out to some phones at the time of writing, and is most likely in testing. If it works well, we'll likely see it on the main Maps app before long, bringing Google Maps one step closer to its restaurant review rivals Yelp and TripAdvisor.",https://www.engadget.com/2019/05/03/google-maps-photos-most-popular-restaurant-dishes/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

19328,SpaceX admits crew capsule exploded in April engine test,"Elon Musk-led aerospace startup SpaceX has confirmed that one of Crew Dragon capsules, meant for human spaceflight, was destroyed in the failed April 20 engine test. An attempt to test-fire the eight 'SuperDraco' engines had triggered the explosion, SpaceX revealed. The destroyed capsule was the same vehicle that had successfully docked with the International Space Station in March.",Reuters,"(Corrects day of week in first paragraph and corrects location of accident in third paragraph) By Joey Roulette CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla., May 2 (Reuters) - Nearly two weeks after a fiery explosion during a ground test of its new crew capsule, SpaceX confirmed on Thursday that the vehicle was destroyed, but neither the company nor NASA, its primary customer, have publicly acknowledged the nature of the mishap. Instead, Hans Koenigsmann, vice president of flight reliability for California-based Space Exploration Technologies Corp, known as SpaceX, continued to refer to the accident simply as an “anomaly” - science jargon for when something goes wrong. The April 20 accident occurred on a landing zone at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station as SpaceX was conducting a test of emergency thrusters designed to propel the capsule, dubbed Crew Dragon, to safety from atop the rocket in the event of a launch failure. An attempt to test-fire the eight SuperDraco engines triggered the accident, demolishing the entire vehicle on a test stand, Koenigsmann told reporters at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center. “Just prior, before we wanted to fire the SuperDraco, there was an anomaly and the vehicle was destroyed,” Koenigsmann said on Thursday. “There were no injuries. SpaceX had taken all safety measures prior to this test, as we always do.” The news conference was called ahead of Friday’s scheduled launch of an unmanned resupply mission to the international space station using a cargo-only capsule built by SpaceX, the private rocket venture of billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk. When pressed, Koenigsmann declined to characterize the nature of the accident, including whether an explosion or fire was involved. NASA has likewise demurred when asked to describe the mishap. A leaked video of the accident, which was acknowledged as authentic by a NASA contractor in an internal memo obtained by the Orlando Sentinel newspaper, showed the astronaut capsule blasting into smithereens. A pall of smoke was also widely observed rising over the launch pad from a distance at the time of the ill-fated test. The Crew Dragon had been scheduled to carry U.S. astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley to the International Space Station in a test mission in July, although the recent accident, as well as some other hitches in the vehicle’s design, are likely to push that schedule to later in the year or into 2020. “It’s certainly not great news for the schedule overall, but I hope we can recover,” Koenigsmann said. The destroyed vehicle was one of six such capsules built or in late production by SpaceX, and the first flown into space. A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket launched it without crew to the space station in March for a six-day visit before returning to Earth, splashing down safely in the Atlantic for retrieval. “We have no reason to believe there is an issue with the SuperDracos themselves,” Koenigsmann said, adding that the engines have been tested nearly 600 times in the past. NASA has been awarded $6.8 billion to SpaceX and rival Boeing Co to develop separate capsule systems to fly astronauts to space, but both companies have faced technical challenges and delays.

Around ten lakh people were evacuated before the cyclone had made landfall.",Reuters,"BHUBANESWAR, India/ DHAKA (Reuters) - A cyclone barrelled into eastern India on Friday, damaging houses in the tourist town of Puri and wounding 160 people after a million people were moved into storm shelters. Trees were uprooted, power and telecom lines snapped as Tropical Cyclone Fani, the strongest storm to hit India in five years, swept ashore the eastern state of Odisha. Bangladesh, which lies further up the path of Tropical Cyclone Fani, ordered the evacuation of 2.1 million people before the storm arrives on Saturday. Indian government spokesman Sitanshu Kar said there were no reports of deaths but 160 people were believed injured. Bangladesh’s junior disaster minister Enamur Rahman said 56 thousand volunteers were racing to move millions out of the storm’s path. Fani spent days building up power in the northern reaches of the Bay of Bengal before it struck the coast of Odisha at around 8 a.m., the state-run India Meteorological Department (IMD) said.     Howling winds gusting up to 200 kph (124 mph) whipsawed trees, uprooting scores, and driving rain impacted visibility, while streets were deserted in the state capital Bhubaneswar and Puri.  “Damage in Puri is extensive, power supply, telephone lines disrupted,” Odisha’s Special Relief Commissioner Bishnupada Sethi told Reuters, referring to the seaside Hindu temple town that is popular with pilgrims and was directly in the storm’s path. Cyclone tracker Tropical Storm Risk put Fani as a powerful category four storm on a scale of one to five. The IMD said the storm was now weakening. Close to 60 km (37 miles) inland, winds brought down electricity poles in Bhubaneswar, where authorities had ordered the airport to stay closed. Schools and colleges in Odisha were also shut. A major hospital in the city suffered extensive structural damage but all patients and staff were safe, authorities said. “It was a massive cyclone, like many others our house is flooded. Boundary walls of houses around us have collapsed, trees have been uprooted. It is a panic situation,” Anuradha Mohanty, a Bhubaneswar resident, told Reuters. People packed into shelters, spreading mats to wait out the storm, television and social media showed. More than 600 pregnant women were shifted into safe locations, with nearly 500 ambulances on standby. Some 242 medical institutions had been provided with power back-up, government authorities said. Heavy rains lashed the Bangladeshi capital Dhaka and a few coastal districts of the country. Seaports have been ordered shut, a government official said.

""The Attorney General shouldn't be afraid of taking questions"", Cohen had earlier said.",Reuters,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - When Attorney General William Barr refused to appear at a hearing in the U.S. Congress on Thursday, one Democrat decided it was thigh time to act against what he saw as fowl behavior.  Congressman Steve Cohen arrived at a hearing of the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee carrying a bucket of fried chicken and a poultry figurine. He said the props represented the nation’s top law enforcement official, who canceled his planned testimony amid a dispute over the hearing format. “The chicken Barr should have shown up today and answered questions,” the Tennessee Democrat told reporters, after he handed out pieces of fried chicken to other committee members. After the hearing concluded, committee staffers wiped up chicken grease from the area around Cohen’s seat.  Democrats accuse Barr and other administration officials of stonewalling their investigations into Trump’s taxes, his businesses and other topics. Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler said on Thursday that he may hold Barr in contempt of Congress if the attorney general does not turn over an unredacted copy of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.

Yechury asked her, ""Being a pracharak, you narrate the epics but still claim Hindus cannot be violent?""",ANI,"Bhopal (Madhya Pradesh) [India] May 3 (ANI): CPM leader Sitaram Yechury attacked the BJP for fragmenting the society for votes through its divisive policies. The leader went on to brand religious epics Ramayana and Mahabharata as specimens of Hindu violence.""Sadhvi Pragya Singh Thakur said that Hindus don't believe in violence. Many kings and principalities have fought battles in the country. Even the Ramayana and Mahabharata are also filled with instances of violence. Being a pracharak, you narrate the epics but still claim Hindus can't be violent? What is the logic behind saying there is a religion which engages in violence & we Hindus don't,"" he said.""After the initial phases of election got over, they came back to the core Hindutva agenda - Aboloition of Article 35A and 370, Construction of Ram Mandir on the disputed sight, Uniform Civil Code and NRC. On the back of such issues, the decision to bring in Sadhvi Pragya Thakur to contest from Bhopal after the third phase is a step taken based on hyping up the sentiments of the people,"" added Yechury.Yechury recounted the non-violent traditions of the country citing the Mauryan empire's acceptance of the Buddhist philosophy. ""The Mauryan empire accepted Buddhism after the Battle of Kalinga. Ashoka's edicts state that any one who attacks other communities, damages his own community. Our tradition is this and not the one propogated by BJP,"" said the CPM leader.Yechury elaborated in detail the Hindutva design and its genesis by recounting instances from history. ""Vinayak Damodar Savarkar has himself said that Hindutva has no relation with Hinduism. It is a political project. His slogan was 'Hinduize the Military and Militarize the Hindus'. He encouraged the Hindu youth to join the military. This was the way how Hindus were organized into RSS. The person who got inspired by this philosophy was Balakrishna Shivram Moonje. He went to Italy and got inspired by Mussolini. He came back and opened a military academy which inspired the later day Hindu nationalists,"" he said.""So, it is a fallacy to say that Hindus can't engage in violence as historicity doesn't verify this claim. All the private armies that have been built in the name of moral policing are based on this philosophy,"" he contended.Speaking on the BJP government's failings in the present regime, Yechury said, ""according to the reports that have come in, there is not one institution left which the BJP is not using to propogate its political power. These attacks on the institution are not just limited to violating people's democratic rights. We fought against the emergency to save our democracy. This is a combined attack on our democratic setup.""""We don't get any answers on the promises made by the current government five years ago concerning our farmers. Loan waiver or a viable MSP are still elusive as they say that they don't have money for that purpose,"" he added. ""However, they have the money to waive off the loans of big industrialists who are the friends of the government. They have waived off a loan of Rs 5,55,000 crore of the industrialists. On top of that, the industrialists have taken a loan of Rs 11 lakh crore which they are yet to return. Many of them have left the country and the government has no intention to pursue them,"" Yechury said.Yechury also spoke on the funding process of the political parties, in particular, on BJP's use of electoral bonds. ""They brought in electoral bonds which have made the funding process more opaque than ever. According to a recent submission of BJP to the Election Commission, close to 95% of the funds related to electoral bonds have gone to BJP's account,"" he said.Yechury contended that BJP's narrative is that if India has to fight against terrorism, one has to support PM Modi. ""But the reality is that the fight against terrorism is a united effort otherwise we play to the tunes of the terrorists themselves,"" he said.""If you take out the records of terrorist attack. In PM Modi's tenure, 626 terrorist attacks took place and 483 security personnel lost their lives. Ceasefire violations amounted to 5596 compared to 563 in the preceding five years. The number of civilians who died in PM Modi's tenure is 210 as compared to 12 in the preceding five years,"" he corroborated.Finally, Yechury urged the public to vote for Digvijaya Singh and defeat Sadhvi Pragya Singh Thakur from Bhopal.Four phases of election are over and three phases remain on May 6, 12 and 19.

19351,Apple patents in-display fingerprint sensor that can monitor health,"Apple recently secured a patent for an in-display fingerprint sensor technology that may also record health vitals including heart and respiration rates. The patent reveals the technology uses an acoustic imaging system leveraging mechanical waves, acoustic waves or pulses. Apple said the technology can be used for ""biometrically-unique surface characteristics"" such as handprints and ear prints.",BGR,"With the launch of iPhone X in 2017, Apple took the decision to do away with fingerprint sensors as it moved in the direction of an all-screen smartphone. While the Cupertino-based iPhone maker has identified Face ID as a practical solution for biometric authentication, there are a number of users who continue to report that lack of a fingerprint sensor can get daunting at times. And if a new patent filed by Apple is anything to go by then we might see the company bringing back the feature with a future generation of iPhone lineup.Patently Apple has spotted a patent titled “Methods of biometric imaging of input surfaces” that was recently granted to Apple by the US Patent and Trademark Office. The patent describes an acoustic imaging system that can be used to map a high resolution image or biometric of something like a fingerprint placed on the surface. It further describes using an acoustic transducer to convert electrical signals into mechanical energy and vice versa. It illustrates a mechanical wave being produced when the finger is placed on the display and it is then converted into an electrical signal using the transducer.The signal will then be reconstructed into an image of a fingerprint used for biometric authentication. The patent won’t be limited to just fingerprint and explains how the technology could be used to see things beyond fingerprint and could include image of your palm, ear, cheek or face. There could be a scenario where the device could authenticate the user when they place an iPhone next to their ear, for example, while taking a call, the user could be authenticated for an incoming call.Source: Patently AppleThe patent also aligns with Apple’s strategy of gathering more medical data of users and helping them stay fit through devices like Apple Watch. The technology is described as capable of recording vitals of a person like heart and respiration rates. Since the patent describes Apple adding an in-display fingerprint sensor does not mean that the company will be bringing one to an iPhone immediately.In the past, Apple has received patent for several other technological features, which have never made it to a retail device. With Apple having set the future of iPhone into an all-screen device and Face ID becoming the de facto standard of authentication, there is a possibility that this patent only describes technological validity of such a feature. It could even be possible that Apple tried this technology around the launch of iPhone X but could not get it ready in time and then decided to go with Face ID instead.95390",https://www.bgr.in/news/apple-patent-shows-an-in-display-fingerprint-solution-that-could-record-health-vitals/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

19362,I've been an idiot for not buying: Buffett's firm buys Amazon stock,"World's fourth-richest person Warren Buffett has revealed his company Berkshire Hathaway has bought shares of tech giant Amazon.com for the first time. ""I've been a fan, and I've been an idiot for not buying,"" the 88-year-old billionaire told CNBC. Buffett added the purchase was made by one of his investment managers and details would be disclosed in Berkshire's quarterly report.",Reuters,"(Reuters) - Warren Buffett said Berkshire Hathaway Inc has bought shares of internet retailing giant Amazon.com Inc for the first time, though he has not been the one doing the buying, CNBC reported on Thursday. Buffett said the purchase was made by one of his investment managers, Todd Combs or Ted Weschler, and details would be disclosed later this month in Berkshire’s quarterly report of its U.S. stock holdings. The purchase marks a U-turn for Berkshire, where Buffett has long praised the leadership of Amazon Chief Executive Jeff Bezos. “Yeah, I’ve been a fan, and I’ve been an idiot for not buying,” Buffett told CNBC. Buffett’s assistant did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Amazon did not immediately respond to a similar request. Shares of companies often rise when Berkshire reveals its support through new stakes, even when the purchases are believed or known to have been made by Combs or Weschler, who together invest about $26 billion. The initial impetus of the portfolio managers has in the past heralded Buffett’s eventual forays into some of their investments, often in big ways. It was Combs who in 2012 began investing in industrial and aircraft parts maker Precision Castparts Corp. Four years later, Berkshire completed its purchase of that company for $32 billion, in what remains Buffett’s largest acquisition. More recently, it was either Combs or Weschler who in 2016 began investing in iPhone maker Apple Inc. But it was Buffett who ramped up that stake into Berkshire’s largest common stock investment, more than 255 million shares, now worth roughly $53 billion. The Amazon purchase adds an additional bond between Buffett and Bezos, whose companies teamed up last year with JPMorgan Chase & Co to form a new venture, Haven, to reduce employee healthcare costs. Berkshire has more than 90 businesses in the insurance, energy, food and retail, industrial, railroad and other sectors, and often buys stocks when buying whole companies appears too expensive. In February, Buffett called acquisition prices “sky-high for businesses possessing decent long-term prospects.” Buffett and Berkshire Vice Chairman Charlie Munger will on Saturday answer shareholder questions at Berkshire’s annual meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, which normally draws more than 40,000 people.

19368,How did Cyclone Fani get its name and what does it mean?,"The name of Cyclone Fani, which loosely translates to ""hood of a snake"" in Bengali, was suggested by Bangladesh and was picked from a pre-determined list. For tropical cyclones over North Indian Ocean, eight countries including India, Myanmar, Pakistan and Oman have submitted eight names each. Names given by India are Agni, Akash, Bijli, Jal, Lehar, Megh, Sagar and Vayu.",Reuters,"BHUBANESHWAR, India/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India has accelerated efforts to evacuate more than a million people along its northeast coastline as a cyclone intensifies ahead of landfall on Friday, with thousands of villagers piling household possessions on to trucks before fleeing their homes. Severe cyclonic storm Fani was churning up the Bay of Bengal about 275 km (171 miles) south-southwest of the Hindu temple town of Puri where special trains were put on to evacuate tourists and the beaches were empty. In total, about 1.2 million people are expected to be evacuated from low-lying areas of 15 districts in the eastern state of Odisha to cyclone shelters, schools and other buildings, authorities said. More than 800,000 have left so far. “We are maximising efforts at all levels for evacuation,” Odisha’s Special Relief Commissioner Bishnupada Sethi told Reuters. Fani was generating maximum sustained winds of 170-180 km (105-111 miles) per hour, the state-run India Meteorological Department (IMD) said. Cyclone tracker Tropical Storm Risk rated Fani category 4 storm, a notch below the worst level. The cyclone will make landfall before Friday afternoon, the IMD said. The navy has deployed seven warships and has six planes and seven helicopters on standby along with divers, rubber boats, medical teams and relief materials. Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted that the central government will provide all possible assistance. Authorities have also shut down operations at Paradip, Dhamra and Visakhapatnam ports. In Paradip, television footage showed residents piling bicycles, sewing machines and gas cylinders on to small trucks and leaving for any of nearly 900 shelters supplied with food, water and medicines. Odisha state government has deployed hundreds of disaster management personnel, closed schools and colleges and asked doctors and other health officials not to go on leave until May 15. India’s cyclone season can last from April to December, when severe storms batter coastal cities and cause widespread deaths and damage to crops and property in both India and neighbouring Bangladesh. Technological advancements have helped meteorologists to predict weather patterns well in advance, giving authorities more time to prepare. In 1999, a super-cyclone battered the coast of Odisha for 30 hours, killing 10,000 people. A mass evacuation of nearly a million people saved thousands of lives in 2013. In a Tweet, Indian airline Vistara, a joint venture of India’s Tata Sons and Singapore Airlines Ltd, said it would waive cancellation charges for flights to Odisha’s capital, Bhubaneswar, and Kolkata, the capital of West Bengal,  until Sunday. Kolkata airport will be shut from 2130 hrs local time on Friday till 1800 hrs on Saturday while Bhubaneswar airport will be shut on Friday. IndiGo Airlines, the country’s largest domestic carrier, said it had cancelled flights to and from Bhubaneswar on Friday. GoAir in a Tweet said it would waive cancellation charges for flights to Bhubaneswar, Kolkata and Ranchi for travel till May 5. Indian Oil Corp, the country’s top refiner, said its 300,000 barrels per day (bpd) Paradip refinery in Odisha state did not need to shut down for now. An executive at Reliance Industries Ltd, which operates an oil and gas block off the east coast, said its operations had not been affected. India’s National Aluminium Co Ltd said there was no need to halt operations. State-run power company NTPC Ltd has no plans to shut the 3000-megawatt Talcher power plant in Odisha, its head of operations Prakash Tiwari said. “The power plant will be running as usual, should something happen we are prepared for any eventuality.” Additional reporting by Subrata Nagchoudhury in KOLKATA; Devjoyot Ghoshal, Neha Dasgupta and Nidhi Verma in NEW DELHI; Promit Mukherjee in MUMBAI; Editing by Nick Macfie and Toby Chopra",https://in.reuters.com/article/us-india-cyclone/towns-evacuate-tourists-flee-as-cyclone-menaces-indias-east-coast-idINKCN1S8071?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

The baby's body was found by a US Border Patrol search and rescue team. Three other migrants, including two children, are still missing.",Reuters,"(Reuters) - The body of a 10-month-old boy was recovered on Thursday and three other migrants, including two children, were still missing after their raft capsized as they crossed the Rio Grande in Texas, U.S. Border Patrol said. The rubber raft flipped over on Wednesday night near Del Rio, Texas, and all nine of its occupants were swept away in the cold, fast-flowing water, according to the father of the dead child, U.S. Border Patrol said in a statement. The father swam to safety. A Border Patrol agent jumped into the river and rescued his wife and 6-year-old son. The boy was given emergency care and then rushed to a hospital for advanced treatment. Another man and his son were found on the river bank. The missing were believed to include the 7-year-old nephew of the dead child’s father, a girl and an adult male, according to the statement.  “What we’re dealing with now is senseless tragedy,” Del Rio Sector Chief Patrol Agent Raul Ortiz said in a statement.  The baby’s body was found several miles downriver by a Border Patrol search and rescue team. Drownings are common on the Rio Grande, which makes up part of the U.S.-Mexico border, as migrants try to cross on often overcrowded, makeshift rafts with no life jackets. But rescues have increased since October as record numbers of Central American families try to enter the United States. In the Del Rio sector alone, Border Patrol have rescued more than 200 people since October, a more than 800 percent rise from the year-earlier period. Up to Thursday the sector had recorded five water-related deaths in that period, according to sector data. Spring is the most dangerous time of year to cross the river, with the Rio Grande now near flood stage with the release of runoff water from the mountains of Colorado and New Mexico.  In the past seven months, Border Patrol has apprehended over 418,000 migrants on the southwest border, already surpassing the 2018 fiscal-year total. Most of those arrested were Central American families, many of them crossing the border in large groups that can number over 400 people. U.S. Customs and Border Protection recorded 283 deaths on the border in 2018, ranging from heat-related fatalities to drownings. That was down from a high of 492 in 2005 when annual apprehensions stood at nearly 1.2 million. Migrant advocates say the death toll is far greater as many bodies are never recovered from deserts and the Rio Grande.

19372,I've protected many: Assange refuses to be extradited to US,"WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has told a UK court his work had protected ""many people"". Further, he refused to agree to be extradited to the US, which has charged him with conspiracy to commit computer intrusion. ""I'm a journalist winning many, many awards,"" Assange, who was sentenced to 50 weeks in prison by a British court for skipping bail, added.",Reuters,"LONDON (Reuters) - WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange told a London court on Thursday his work had protected “many people” and refused to agree to be extradited to the United States to face trial for one of the largest compromises of classified information in history. The United States has requested the extradition of Assange, who was dragged from the Ecuadorean Embassy in London on April 11, and has charged him with conspiracy to commit computer intrusion which carries a maximum penalty of five years. Asked at a preliminary hearing at Westminster Magistrates’ Court whether he agreed to be extradited to the United States,  Assange, appearing via a video link from a British prison, said: “I do not wish to surrender for extradition. I’m a journalist winning many, many awards and protecting many people.” Assange made international headlines in early 2010 when WikiLeaks published a classified U.S. military video showing a 2007 attack by Apache helicopters in Baghdad that killed a dozen people, including two Reuters news staff. To some, Assange is a hero for exposing what supporters cast as abuse of power by modern states and for championing free speech. To others, he is a dangerous rebel who has undermined U.S. security.  On Wednesday, he was sentenced to 50 weeks in prison by a British court for skipping bail after fleeing to Ecuador’s Embassy in London, where he remained for seven years until police dragged him out last month. Assange had sought refuge in the embassy in June 2012 to avoid extradition to Sweden to face an allegation of rape, which he denies, saying he feared he would be sent to the United States to face action over the WikiLeaks’ release of classified U.S. diplomatic cables. Hours after his arrest last month, U.S. prosecutors said they had charged Assange with conspiracy in trying to access a classified U.S. government computer. “The charge relates to one of the largest compromises of classified information in the history of the United States,” said Ben Brandon, the lawyer representing the United States. He said in early 2010, former U.S. Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning had downloaded 90,000 activity reports relating to the Afghan war, 400,000 relating to the conflict in Iraq, 800 Guantanamo Bay detainee assessment briefs and 250,000 U.S. diplomatic cables. The vast majority of these were later released on WikiLeaks. There were computer room chats showing real-time discussions between Manning and Assange over cracking a password to gain access to classified U.S. documents and the public release of the information, Brandon said.  “Despite what you heard from the prosecutor in the courtroom today, this case is not about hacking,” Assange’s lawyer Jennifer Robinson said outside court. “This case is about a journalist and a publisher who had conversations with a source about accessing material, encouraged that source to provide material and spoke to that source about how to protect their identity. This is protected activity that journalists engage in all the time.”  She said the action against him had been launched under former U.S. President Barack Obama and aggressively pursued by the administration of Donald Trump. The case was adjourned until May 30 for a procedural hearing with a more substantial hearing planned for June 12. The full extradition hearing was some months away, Judge Michael Snow told the court.

Â“The lower unemployment rate in March was a blip, and it has again climbed following the trend of earlier months,"" CMIE head Mahesh Vyas said. Notably, the government recently withheld jobs data.",Reuters,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India’s unemployment rate in April rose to 7.6 percent, the highest since October 2016, and up from 6.71 percent in March, according to data compiled by the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) released late on Wednesday. “The lower unemployment rate in March was a blip, and it has again climbed following the trend of earlier months,” Mahesh Vyas, head of the Mumbai-based CMIE think-tank, told Reuters. The figures could be a setback for Prime Minister Narendra Modi during a staggered general election that will end on May 19, with opposition parties criticising the government over weak farm prices and low jobs growth. Factory activity expanded at its slowest pace in eight months in April as growth in new orders and output dipped as the general election got under way, a separate private business survey found. Optimism among manufacturing firms also ebbed in April as they remain concerned about what policies a new government will adopt when it takes office by the end of May. The government recently withheld jobs data because officials said they needed to check its veracity.  India usually only releases official unemployment data every five years.  But December unemployment figures were leaked to a newspaper and showed that the jobless rate rose to its highest level in at least 45 years in 2017/18. The government has said it will release jobs data once a year.  The CMIE said in a report released in January that nearly 11 million people lost their jobs in 2018 after the demonetisation of high-value banknotes in late 2016, and the chaotic launch of a new goods and services tax in 2017, hit millions of small businesses. The government told parliament this year that it did not have data on the impact of demonetisation on jobs in small businesses.

While the cause of death was not immediately disclosed, reports suggest that the actor succumbed to a heart condition. Mayhew last featured as Chewbacca in the 2015 film 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens'.",Times Now,"The world’s favourite Wookie, Peter Mayhew, best known for playing Chewbacca aka Chewie in Star Wars films from back in the ‘70s, ‘80s and ‘90s, passed away at the age of 74.

Ever since then, Mayhew appeared as Chewie in The Empire Strikes Back (1980), Return of the Jedi (1983), Revenge of the Sith (2005) and The Force Awakens (2015).

19402,"AAP, Cong competing for 2nd spot: BJP's West Delhi candidate","BJP's West Delhi candidate Parvesh Sahib Verma targeted the Opposition and said, ""AAP has sent dummy candidate in West Delhi...Congress lacks self-confidence. So it's between AAP and Congress to contest for the second spot."" Verma also claimed that Congress is terrified of PM Narendra Modi-led BJP's popularity. ""They're trying new methods to find its ground this election,"" he added.",Times Now,"Parvesh Sahib Singh Verma, the sitting MP of West Delhi, is confident of winning a second term in office in the Lok Sabha polls of 2019, even though he is pitted against Congress heavyweight Mahabal Mishra (whom Parvesh Verma defeated in 2014 by a huge margin of 4,58,129 votes and put to the third position, though Mishra was the sitting MP then) and AAP's Balbir Singh Jakhar.Parvesh Verma wears his father's name woven into his own with pride. After all, the senior Verma was a former chief minister of Delhi and is also reported to have rescued and supported a large number of Sikh families during the 1984 anti-Sikh riots. ""My work has only begun and I have a lot more to give to the people,"" Verma told The Times of India. ""My father did so much for you and now I want to build upon that,"" TOI further quotes Parvesh Verma telling his electorate.The West Delhi constituency is a good mix of Hindu Punjabi/Sikh and Jat population with a sizeable Poorvanchali population. BJP candidate Parvesh Verma hails from the Jat community, so does AAP's Jakhar. The Congress candidate Mishra is from the Poorvanchal region.When timesnownews.com caught up with Parvesh Verma to know about how he reads his prospects in this General Election, the MP, who had utilised all his Members of Parliament Local Area Development Scheme (MPLADS) funds for his constituency's benefit, sounded upbeat. Here's what he told us:  Kirti Pandey: Why did the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) show delay in declaring candidates for Delhi? Was it because of confusion in selecting candidates?Parvesh Verma: The party decides the timing of declaring candidates based on a mix of strategy and party procedure. What is more important is to make our party win and we keep working for that without worrying much about who gets the ticket. In the BJP, the party is above individual interests.Kirti Pandey: Your Congress rival Mahabal Mishra is claiming that he will defeat you this time the way he defeated Jagdeesh Mukhi in 2009. What is your reply?Parvesh Verma: In 2014 elections, Mahabal Mishra did not even stand second in terms of number votes. He has completely lost his ground right from that point. This time, I will not be surprised even if he loses his deposit. Moreover, his relations with his own party president is not something hidden and has further downgraded his election prospects.Kirti Pandey: In the last Lok Sabha elections, your nearest rival was Jarnail Singh of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP). Who do you think will be this time?Parvesh Verma: The AAP has struggled in finding a candidate for West Delhi this time. Earlier it sold the ticket to a person named Rajpal Solanki who ran away midway. Then it brought in Balbir Jhakhar who does not even live in Delhi and is a voter of Haryana. The AAP has sent a dummy candidate in West Delhi this time. Now, talking about the Congress, Mahabal Mishra has no ground left in West Delhi. Moreover, Congress lacks self-confidence. The party has already accepted defeat in the 2019 general elections. So it's between the AAP and the Congress to contest for the second spot.Kirti Pandey: Sheila Dikshit is in the fray for North East Delhi. What do you think will be her effect on the Congress' fortunes in the seven Lok Sabha constituencies of Delhi?Parvesh Verma: The Congress has been terrified of Shri Narendra Modi-led BJP’s popularity. It is trying new methods to find its ground this election. Sheila ji’s return is too feeble in comparison to Narendra Modi’s popularity in Delhi. After miserably losing the Delhi Assembly elections, she left for Uttar Pradesh to run for the chief minister's position (though unsuccessfully). Moreover, Congress is already divided into two camps and does not have one single voice.Kirti Pandey: What have you done in the last five years that will make people vote for you again?Parvesh Verma: I have worked to fulfil each and every major demand of my constituents that they had asked me to do before elections. Some of the major works include the extension of the Metro to the Dhansa stand, construction of a 100-bed hospital in Najafgarh, the International Convention Centre in Dwarka, three new sports stadiums, new MCD schools, 12 new community halls, 650 open gyms and many more projects. Besides that, we have implemented almost all central government schemes in my constituency.Kirti Pandey: The AAP is blaming the Congress for not working out a coalition with it in Delhi. What do you think about that?Parvesh Verma: Arvind Kejriwal-led AAP has failed on every promise on which it came to power and therefore the party is struggling for existence. This forced them to chase the very Congress which it targeted left, right and centre just a few years back. What is the reason that a party with 67 out of 70 seats in Delhi is begging before a party which has no seat? The reason is clear. The AAP has understood that it has no prospects against the BJP this election. Both the AAP and the Congress have been rejected by Delhi.Kirti Pandey: The AAP is demanding full statehood for Delhi. Other parties have changed their stances. What is your view?Parvesh Verma: The AAP’s demand of full statehood is nothing but an excuse for failing in delivering its promises. Delhi’s unique constitutional status has been a reality and when we were in power, our chief ministers did developmental works besides that too. Arvind Kejriwal is an anarchist who wants Delhi to turn into his private territory like he has done to his party. Delhi can be given full statehood only in safe hands and not in Kejriwal's who sat on dharna to stop the republic day parade.Kirti Pandey: How many seats will the BJP win in Delhi and who will win in West Delhi?Parvesh Verma: Delhi has made up its mind to give all the seven seats to the BJP in order to make Narendra Modi ji the prime minister of India. As far as West Delhi is concerned, I am more than assured that people of West Delhi stand firmly with me sighting my own work and the leadership of Narendra Modi ji. I can assure you that West Delhi seat will be won by the BJP with the biggest margin in Delhi.Kirti Pandey: How do you see your efforts to bring a West campus of the Delhi University (DU) in your constituency paying off? Is it really going to happen?The idea of a West Campus of DU was first put up by me. I had raised it in Parliament in 2016. I made consistent efforts to materialise the idea and as a result of that, the land for the West Campus has been already finalised. The work of road construction is in process. As soon as the road is completed, the construction of the West Campus will begin. The West Campus has been my commitment and the speed with which developments have taken place so far, it will soon be constructed.Kirti Pandey: Thank you.The views expressed by the author are personal and do not in any way represent those of Times Network.",https://www.timesnownews.com/elections/article/aap-candidate-is-dummy-mahabal-mishra-will-lose-deposit-parvesh-verma/411241?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

I didn't realise that it was part of the first CSK song."" ""Whenever they see me they don't call me by my name, they call me 'Thala'. It feels very special,"" the 37-year-old added.",CricTracker,"MS Dhoni, on Wednesday, once again showed why is he adored so much by the Chennai Super Kings faithful. The defending champions were low on confidence after being routed by Mumbai Indians last week. With Dhoni missing the game due to fever, the Super Kings were all out for just 109 in one of the worst performances of their glittering journey in IPL. And it did not take Dhoni very long to show why the team missed him against Mumbai.The veteran wicketkeeper-batsman starred with both bat and gloves as Super Kings thrashed Delhi Capitals by 80 runs to return to winning ways. Dhoni first made his mark with the bat, hitting 44 from 22 including 19 off Trent Boult’s last over that ultimately yielded 21 runs. At 87 for 2 in the 14th over when Dhoni walked out to bat, the Super Kings were looking set to end on a below-par score.AdvertisementHowever, Dhoni once again showcased his finishing ability to guide them to a big total. He then made his mark with a couple of lighting quick stumping to get rid of Chris Morris and Shreyas Iyer in a space of three balls. Delhi Capitals were eventually all out for just 99 as Dhoni’s side sealed their spot in the top two of the points table. Dhoni walked away with another Man of the Match gong this season. Speaking after the game, Dhoni opened up about the last over and how he sneaked in a bye to get back on strike for the last two balls.“I watch the ball and hit the ball. I think by 20th over you are almost ready and you swing at everything. It’s easier for somebody who has played 10 or 15 deliveries than somebody who has just come in to bat. It was holding on a bit, it wasn’t coming on nicely. I felt it was slightly difficult for Rayudu (Ambati) to hit. Rishabh helped me, he didn’t take his gloves off and that helped me a bit (to sneak in the bye),” said MS Dhoni at the presentation ceremony.Dhoni is fondly called Thala by the Super Kings fans. A Tamil word, Thala means boss and Dhoni said the nickname is very special for him as he expressed his delight over the love he receives in Tamil Nadu.“I have always said it’s very special to get that kind of a nickname. It’s a big nickname that they have given me. It feels really special. I didn’t realise that it was part of the first CSK song.

19421,You've to be careful on what you post: Neesham on Faulkner's post,"Reacting to Australian all-rounder James Faulkner's 'boyfriend' Instagram post, New Zealand all-rounder Jimmy Neesham said, ""You've to be careful about what you post online in the age we live in."" ""A lot of things are taken as offensive when theyÂ’re not meant to be offensive,"" he added. The post led media to incorrectly report that Faulkner's in a same-sex relationship.",CricTracker,"Not only the fans but New Zealand star Jimmy Neesham also thought that Australian cricketer James Faulkner was gay after the latter’s confusing post on social media. On his 29th birthday, Faulkner had raised a lot of eyebrows with his choice of words when he posted a picture of him sitting alongside his mother and another male friend.  Faulkner had referred his friend Rob Jubb as ‘the boyfriend’ while adding the hashtag #togetherfor5years.Not very surprisingly, many believed that the allrounder used the occasion to announce that he was gay. The post drew nearly a thousand comments, including Australian teammates David Warner and Glen Maxwell. In fact, Maxwell had also congratulated Faulkner for his “courage”, thinking that his teammate had come out of the closet.AdvertisementBut just hours later, Faulkner had taken to social media once again to dismiss the speculations. The World Cup-winning star denied being the first Australian professional cricketer to reveal publicly that he’s in a same-sex relationship while also thanking for the overwhelming support. He had also edited his post, replacing “boyfriend” with “best friend”. Cricket Australia had also issued a public statement, apologising for the confusion due to Faulkner’s post.When it comes to having fun on social media, Neesham is definitely the best in the business. The New Zealand allrounder knows how to get involved with the fans and the followers in order to enjoy some banter. And the social-media expert has now delivered some words of wisdom for his Australian rival, asking him to be more careful while posting on social media.“It’s one of those things that can happen, isn’t it?” Neesham told Newshub. “I think you have to be very clear about what you’re saying on social media. I think people can definitely take things the wrong way or take things the way they think will get the most clicks. People take things the way they want to take them, I think, occasionally.“Obviously, James has not been entirely clear on what he meant, but I think everyone will move forward and sort of forget about it. I saw the post in the morning and didn’t really think much about it to be fair. It isn’t really a significant thing for me if he’s gay or if he’s not gay, it doesn’t really bother me.”“You do [have to be careful] in the age that we live in. A lot of things are taken as offensive when they’re not meant to be offensive. Obviously, a lie gets around the world before the truth has a chance to get its pants on, so I think you have to be pretty careful about the way you word things. Certainly, you have to think about things before you put them up,” he added.",https://www.crictracker.com/jimmy-neesham-advises-james-faulkner-after-boyfriend-post/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

The exports were affected as demand from China, the country's biggest buyer, declined. China does not allow imports of Indian buffalo meat due to fears over foot-and-mouth disease but it's often smuggled into the country through neighbouring nations.",Reuters,"MUMBAI (Reuters) - India’s buffalo meat exports fell 8.7 percent in 2018/19 from a year ago to the lowest level in six years, a government body said on Thursday, as demand moderated from the country’s biggest buyer China.  India’s buffalo meat exports were 1.23 million tonnes in the fiscal year that ended March 31, the lowest since 2012/13, the Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA) said in a statement. China, which accounts for more than half of Indian shipments of buffalo meat, has been buying less in the last few months, said Fauzan Alavi, vice president of the All India Meat & Livestock Exporters Association. “China is a huge market for us. Other buyers couldn’t replace it. Exports will fall further in the current year,” he said. Beijing does not allow imports of Indian buffalo beef due to fears over foot-and-mouth disease but the meat is often smuggled into the country through neighbouring nations along with other foods that have also been prohibited by China. India’s buffaloes are mainly used for dairy and are only slaughtered for meat after their milk productivity has peaked. New Delhi’s rice exports in 2018/19 dropped 7.2 percent from a year earlier to 11.95 million tonnes, the APEDA added. The drop was mainly due to poor demand for non-basmati rice from Bangladesh and African countries, it said, adding exports of non-basmati rice fell 14.5 percent from a year ago to 7.53 million tonnes. Rice exports in the current fiscal year could fall further due to an appreciating rupee and a rise in local prices, said a Mumbai-based dealer with a global trading firm. India’s guar gum exports rose 3.9 percent to 513,218 tonnes in the last fiscal year due to good demand from top buyer the United States, the APEDA said. India is the world’s biggest exporter of buffalo meat, guar gum and rice. The country’s exports of pulses jumped 59 percent last year to 285,783 tonnes, while dairy exports surged 77 percent to 180,682 tonnes due to government incentives for exports of skimmed milk powder, the agency said.

They are in place. There has been a complete disregard for those values.“There has been a complete breakdown in trust between Alex and the team.

I communicated this to Ashley Giles and the decision was made. It’s important now that Alex uses the support around him to try to turn things around.”Morgan revealed that he had spoken to Hales after he was dropped, but his junior team-mate had declined to reveal to the skipper why he was missing Nottinghamshire games before news of the suspension emerged.“Nobody knew,” said batsman Morgan. “When Alex was missing games for Notts I sent him a text to make sure he was alright.“He said it was personal reasons and he needed time away from the game but didn’t indicate anything was awry.

He made the revelation in the chapter wherein he described his call-up to senior team in 1996. This means Afridi would've been 21 and not 16 when he became ""youngest ODI century scorer"" in 1996.",CricTracker,"Apart from his big-hitting ability, former Pakistan captain Shahid Afridi has also been in the news for another reason: his age. As per records, the former international cricketer was born on March 1, 1980, and made his debut as a 16-year-old in 1996. However, not many people were convinced with the cricketer’s age. However, Afridi recently revealed his name in his autobiography ‘Game Changer’.Afridi revealed his real birth year as 1975, which is five years earlier than the year in public space. However, the specific date and month were not told about. Afridi had slammed a 37-ball 100 against Sri Lanka in 1996 but while it was said then that he did it as a teenager, he was around 20-21 as per the birth date revealed in his autobiography. Afridi though wrote that he had smashed the century at the age of 19, which has confused a lot of people.Advertisement“Also, for the record, I was just nineteen, and not sixteen like they claim. I was born in 1975. So, yes, the authorities stated my age incorrectly,” the player, who still plays in franchise cricket, wrote. Afridi’s record had stayed as the fastest hundred in ODI for nearly two decades before New Zealand’s Corey Anderson bettered it by a ball (36) in 2014 against the Windies.If Afridi was born in 1975, it would also mean that he would have been around 34-35 when he suddenly called it quits from Test cricket in 2010, after having returned after a four-year hiatus from the longer format as the captain and playing just one game. His newly revealed birth year also means he had played his final game for Pakistan at the 2016 T20 World Cup at the age of 40-41.Afridi, who has played 27 Tests, 398 ODIs and 99 T20Is for Pakistan and also took part in the Indian Premier League, scored over 11,000 runs and took more than 500 wickets.

Criticising PM Narendra Modi, she added there'll be consequences if the voice of the people is drowned by the voice of ""one leader"".",India.com,"True nationalism means love of the people and for the country but the BJP mirrors neither love nor respect in anything it does, says Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra. Stepping up her attack on the saffron party and Prime Minister Narendra Modi for failing to address real issues, Priyanka said there will be consequences if the voice of the people is drowned by the voice of one leader.In an exclusive interview to PTI, the Congress leader also said there is growing “public anger and pain” for which the people of India will give a message to Modi on May 23 when the votes for the Lok Sabha polls will be counted.“I believe true nationalism is love for the people and love for the country, which means respect and I do not see respect for the people in anything they are doing,” Priyanka Gandhi said in an interview during her campaign through the constituencies represented by her mother and brother.While Sonia Gandhi is the MP from Rae Bareli, Rahul Gandhi represents Amethi in the Lok Sabha.“Nationalism means solving the problems of the people of the country. The greatest patriotism of any politician, of any government, would be to be able to hear the people when they speak, would be to be democratic, to be able to strengthen the institutions that strengthen the public voice, not weaken it,” Priyanka Gandhi said.The BJP has been building its campaign narrative around the issue of nationalism and national security and the party has been referring to the Balakot air strikes and the Modi government’s policy in tackling terror.Priyanka Gandhi, who has been vigorously campaigning in Rae Bareli and Amethi, said the Modi government’s policies have led to large scale public anger and pain among people.“I think the people will give the message to him (PM) because I think wherever I go, I see a lot of public anger, public pain, which has not been addressed,” the Congress general secretary in-charge of eastern Uttar Pradesh said.“Any leader whether it is him (Modi) or anyone else, if public pain is not addressed, if the voice of the people is drowned by the voice of one leader or by the kind of ideology they have, they will have to suffer the consequences. So I think the people are very clear,” she said.She said the ongoing Lok Sabha elections are very crucial as the Congress is fighting to protect the idea of India and the contest is between ideologies.“It is an election in which we are fighting for the India that we all love, for democracy, and for all those values of democracy that we hold dear because institutions are being destroyed by this government,” she said.Asked whether she is dejected about not contesting the Lok Sabha polls from Varanasi against Modi, Priyanka Gandhi said she “feared no one” and went by the direction of the party.She said it is important for her to strengthen the party in Uttar Pradesh as she is campaigning not for herself but for the Congress’ candidates.Asked what the ongoing elections meant for her personally, considering she and her family have been targeted by the BJP, the Congress leader said, “This is part of BJP’s politics.”“They have targeted every person who has spoken against them whether it is a school teacher in Uttar Pradesh or an opposition leader in New Delhi. This is the methodology of their politics and it is the methodology of an undemocratic mindset,” she alleged.Asked whether taking the plunge into party politics earlier this year was difficult, she replied with a smile, “Not at all.”Priyanka Gandhi was named AICC general secretary this January.She said she found BJP’s flagship Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi “offensive and insulting” as it was announced on election eve.“Kisan Samman Yojna is offensive because for the last five years you (the BJP) have done nothing for the farmers. You have not only done nothing for them, you have pushed them into debt,” she said.“While you (Modi government) have been helping all the big businessmen and waiving their loans, you have pushed the farmers into debt. You have pushed farmers into a situation where 12,000 people are committing suicide for nothing..for just Rs 10,000, or for Rs 2,000 and you have done nothing to help them,” she said.“And now because the election is coming you think you can fool them by sending Rs 2,000 in their bank accounts.

19466,Brian Lara only cricketer to score 500 runs in an innings,"Ex-Windies captain Brian Lara scored 501*(427) in a county match in 1994, becoming the first and the only player to score 500-plus runs in an innings in professional cricket. Lara hit 62 fours and 10 sixes during his innings, while representing Warwickshire against Durham. Lara, who turns 50 today, also holds the record for the highest individual Test score (400*).",Cricket Country,"June 6, 1994. Brian Lara became the first batsman in the history of First-Class cricket to score half a thousand runs in an innings.  Arunabha Sengupta looks back at the day he ended his colossal innings at 501 not out for Warwickshire against Durham.For 35 years, the highest score in First-Class cricket had hovered heartbreakingly on the fringe of half a thousand. In 1959, Hanif Mohammad had been run out going for that elusive run which would have taken him to 500. And on this day at Edgbaston, three and a half decades later, Brian Lara drove John Morris off the penultimate ball of the match to gallop from 497 to 501. This was just two months after he had rewritten the Test world record of Garfield Sobers, hammering 375 at Antigua.Five hundred and one is huge enough when one talks in terms of the team score. The benign wicket and the rather ordinary attack notwithstanding, scoring five hundred runs in a single innings is a miracle of immense proportions. After the triumphant batsman had raised his arms heavenwards and left the ground, a queue hastily formed — of about as many people as the number of runs he scored — all demanding the complete scorecard of the game. There was a sense of dazed satisfaction that pervaded the ground. History had been scripted, of the most epic proportions. The mementos were now in demand, to prove that they had been there, cheering all the way to as the master crafted his way to the milestone.
Dennis Amiss was the Chief Executive at Edgbaston in 1994. A couple of months earlier he had spoken to Cricketcountry and had recalled the day:  “I was busy with something and when I looked up he was on 150. I became busy again, and the next time I looked up he was past 200. I looked down again and up again, and he was past 300. I said to myself that this was something special and better to see the whole thing through.”The most exhausted man in the ground was perhaps Brian Hunt, the Durham scorer. He admitted never having worked this hard in his life, but it had been well worth it.Durham batsman David Graveney had one of the best views on the ground. He stood at gully, almost throughout the innings, and his eyes followed the ball as they left the rapier like bat and hastened through the off-side. A major portion of Lara’s runs that day came through the covers. Graveney tried to follow the old adage of watching the bat to anticipate the ball, but later admitted that most often it was just a blur.Lara had been graced with luck and bountiful blessing of the elements.  On Friday he had been bowled off a no-ball when at 10 and dropped by wicketkeeper Chris Scott six runs later. He had piled on 111 by the end of the day, his world record seventh hundred in eight matches — and somehow, the most fortuitous one. And then rain had poured through Saturday, stripping the match of any chance of a result, leaving Lara with the full license to strive for the personal summit.Yet, 390 runs in a day is not something mortals aim for. And neither were runs gifted to him. Durham captain Phil Bainbridge later said that his team was trying their utmost to salvage bonus points. The bowling was tight —by standards that do not bind all but the genius. And we need to consider that for a considerable while during the day Lara had been gifting the strike to Keith Piper, shepherding his teammate to a century.On the Monday, he did flounder once on 238 — a half chance which was not taken.  At 413 he hit it in the air and in the direction of Michael Burns, his Warwickshire teammate who was fielding for Durham. Burns, by volition or otherwise we will never know, failed to reach it.He took a while to reach top gear, adding just 27 runs to his overnight 111 in his first 41 balls. Then the strokes erupted in a flurry of exquisite drives, cuts and pulls — 147 from the next 78 deliveries, including a gigantic six off David Cox over mid-wicket, taking him to 285 at lunch. With the refreshments of the break came the whiff of what could happen. Lara asked Dermot Reeve not to declare.Records tumbled continuously till the end of the match. The triple hundred, the first ever at Birmingham, came soon enough — in 278 balls with 44 fours and seven sixes. At 306, he passed the highest ever score registered by a Warwickshire batsman. At 325, he emulated Don Bradman by scoring 1,000 first-class runs in only seven innings. The quadruple century was reached soon enough, from 350 balls in a little over six hours. Just before tea, he swung Simon Brown over square- leg to go past Graeme Hick’s 405 for Worcestershire against Somerset in 1988, the highest score in England in the twentieth century. And just after the break, he nudged Cox to third man to go past Archie MacLaren’s 99-year-old record for the highest score ever achieved in England — 424 for Lancashire against Somerset in Taunton in 1895.And at 458, he went past Charlie Macartney’s effort against Nottinghamshire in 1921 which had brought him a world record 345 runs in a day.He reached 475 with his 60th boundary, to go with nine sixes. It was a new record for the number of strokes amounting to four or more.At 497, occasional medium-pacer and double centurion in the first innings, John Morris, started bowling what would be the last over of the match. Strangely, Lara was not aware of the approaching end. He played three dot balls and then was surprised by a bouncer to be hit on the helmet off the fourth. It fell upon Piper to run down and remind Lara that the game could be called off in another two balls. That was enough. Lara drove the next ball past extra-cover for four and the final batting frontier fell to the exploits of his willow. He walked away in the direction of the pavilion, having brought up his half-thousand in 474 minutes and 427 balls, with 62 fours and 10 sixes. Every Durham player applauded as he was cheered off the ground by spectators.Reeve declared immediately, at 810 for four in response to 556 for eight. The match ended at that moment.When contacted by BBC radio, Hanif Mohammad was gracious and charming. “First of all let me congratulate Brian. It is a magnificent achievement to score 501 in first-class cricket. I knew he was capable of it because he broke the world record in Test cricket. I’ve been watching him for the last three years and he’s a magnificent cricketer. “When I got 499, people said nobody could break that, but I said ‘I broke the world record of Sir Don Bradman after so many years,’ so records are meant to be broken.”Lara, for his part, just expressed the desire to sneak into Antigua quietly once the county season was over.(Arunabha Sengupta is a cricket historian and Chief Cricket Writer at CricketCountry.

According to Shukla, the first strike was conducted in 2008, second in 2011, three strikes were conducted in 2013 and the last strike was carried out in 2014. ""We never did chest thumping,"" said Shukla.",Times Now,"New Delhi: In a significant development, the Congress party on Thursday claimed that ‘six surgical strikes’ were carried during the UPA regime. The claim was made by senior Congress leader Rajiv Shukla, who also listed the dates when these ‘surgical strikes’ were conducted.Speaking at a press conference, Shukla said six surgical strikes were conducted when the Congress-led UPA was in power while two were carried out during the tenure of late former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee.“We never did chest thumping. The one who did only one surgical strike is patting his back. Neither Dr Manmohan Singh nor Vajpayee did a press conference on it,” Shukla told the press.It may be noted that Vajpayee was PM between 1999 and 2004, while the UPA ruled the country from 2004 to 2014.Listing out the surgical strikes, Shukla said the first was conducted on June 19, 2008 in Bhattal Sector in Jammu and Kashmir’s Poonch. The second was conducted on Aug 30-September 1, 2011 in Sharda Sector across Neelam River Valley in Kel.The third surgical strike was carried out on January 6, 2013 at Sawan Patra Checkpost; fourth on July 27-28, 2013 at Nazapir Sector; fifth on August 6, 2013 at Neelam Valley; and sixth surgical strike on January 14, 2014.Two such surgical strikes that were conducted during the Vajpayee tenure, as per Shukla, were on January 21, 2000 at Nadala Enclave across the Neelam River and on September 18, 2003 at Baroh Sector in Poonch.The Congress party and the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party have been engaged in a war of words over the surgical strikes ever since the Narendra Modi government conducted air strikes inside Pakistan on February 26 this year.The air strikes at a Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorist camp in Balakot followed the deadly terror attack on a CRPF convoy in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pulwama, in which 40 personnel were martyred.The NDA government had conducted its first surgical strike in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir in September 2016, just days after the terror attack at an Indian Army camp in Uri.",https://www.timesnownews.com/india/article/explosive-claim-by-congress-leader-says-six-surgical-strikes-conducted-during-upa-regime/411246?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
19469,Faulty Tesla Autopilot killed Apple engineer in car crash: Lawsuit,"Tesla is being sued by the family of an Apple engineer who died aged 38 after his Tesla Model X crashed. The lawsuit alleges Tesla's Autopilot misread lane lines, failed to detect a highway divider and instead of breaking, it accelerated into it. ""Two children lost their father because Tesla is beta testing Autopilot on live drivers,"" the lawyers alleged.",TechCrunch,"The family of Walter Huang, an Apple  engineer who died after his Tesla Model X with Autopilot engaged crashed into a highway median, is suing Tesla. The State of California Department of Transportation is also named in the lawsuit.The wrongful death lawsuit, filed in California Superior Court, County of Santa Clara, alleges that errors by Tesla’s Autopilot driver assistance system caused the crash that killed Huang on March 23, 2018. Huang, who was 38, died when his 2017 Tesla Model X hit a highway barrier on Highway 101 in Mountain View, Calif.The lawsuit alleges that Tesla’s Autopilot driver assistance system misread lane lines, failed to detect the concrete media, failed to brake and instead accelerated into the median.A Tesla spokesperson declined to comment on the lawsuit.“Mrs. Huang lost her husband, and two children lost their father because Tesla is beta testing its Autopilot software on live drivers,” B. Mark  Fong, a partner at law firm Minami Tamaki said in a statement.Other allegations against Tesla include product liability, defective product design, failure to warn, breach of warranty, intentional and negligent misrepresentation and false advertising. California DOT is also named in the lawsuit because the concrete highway median that Huang’s vehicle struck was missing its crash attenuator guard, according to the filing. Caltrans failed to replace the guard after an earlier crash there, the lawsuit alleges.The lawsuit aims to “ensure the technology behind semi-autonomous cars is safe before it is released on the roads, and its risks are not withheld or misrepresented to the public,” said Doris Cheng, a partner at Walkup, Melodia, Kelly & Schoenberger, who is also representing the family.In the days following the crash, Tesla released two blog posts and ended up scuffling with the National Transportation Safety Board, which had sent investigators to the crash scene.Tesla’s March 30 blog post acknowledged Autopilot had been engaged at the time of the crash. Tesla said the driver had received several visual and one audible hands-on warnings earlier in the drive and the driver’s hands were not detected on the wheel for six seconds prior to the collision.Those comments prompted a response from the NTSB, which indicated it was “unhappy with the release of investigative information by Tesla.” The NTSB requires companies that are a party to an agency accident investigation to not release details about the incident to the public without approval.Tesla CEO Elon Musk  would soon chime in via Twitter to express his own disappointment and criticism of the NTSB.Three weeks after the crash, Tesla issued a statement placing the blame on Huang and denying moral or legal liability for the crash.“According to the family, Mr. Huang was well aware that Autopilot was not perfect and, specifically, he told them it was not reliable in that exact location, yet he nonetheless engaged Autopilot at that location. The crash happened on a clear day with several hundred feet of visibility ahead, which means that the only way for this accident to have occurred is if Mr. Huang was not paying attention to the road, despite the car providing multiple warnings to do so.”The relationship between NTSB and Tesla would disintegrate further following the statement. Tesla said it withdrew from its party agreement with the NTSB. Within a day, NTSB claimed that it had removed Tesla as a party to its crash investigation.A preliminary report from the NTSB didn’t make any conclusions of what caused the crash. But it did find that the vehicle accelerated from 62 mph to 70.8 mph in the final three seconds before impact and moved left as it approached the paved gore area dividing the main travel lane of 101 and Highway 85 exit ramp.The report also found that in the 18 minutes and 55 seconds prior to impact, the Tesla provided two visual alerts and one auditory alert for the driver to place his hands on the steering wheel. The alerts were made more than 15 minutes before the crash.Huang’s hands were detected on the steering wheel only 34 seconds during the last minute before impact. No pre-crash braking or evasive steering movement was detected, the report said.The case is Sz Hua Huang et al v.

19489,Jet Airways down 20% on report bidders not keen to follow up,"Jet Airways shares fell up to 20% on Thursday to a ten-year low after a media report said bidders for the airline haven't followed up on their offers. Three out of four qualified bidders Â– Etihad Airways, TPG Capital and Indigo Partners Â– reportedly haven't signed agreements for conducting due diligence. Bidders have until May 10 to submit binding offers.",Reuters,"NEW DELHI/BENGALURU (Reuters) - Potential bidders for Jet Airways Ltd have so far failed to show any firm interest in bailing out the struggling airline, a source involved in the matter said, increasing the likelihood that the company will face bankruptcy proceedings. Jet, once India’s largest private airline, was forced to stop all flight operations on April 17 after its lenders declined to extend more funds to keep the carrier going. “Companies that had submitted initial expressions of interest are not following up with binding bids,” said the source.  A second source involved in the process said bidders had until May 10 to come up with binding offers, a few days later than the April 30 date indicated by lead lender State Bank of India (SBI) last month.   Both sources, speaking on Thursday, declined to be identified because the talks are not public. Jet, saddled with roughly $1.2 billion of bank debt, and SBI did not respond to emails seeking comment. Earlier on Thursday, The Economic Times, citing sources, reported that three of the four qualified bidders - Etihad Airways, TPG Capital and Indigo Partners - had not signed the non-disclosure agreements necessary for conducting due diligence. The Indian civil aviation regulator has said that lessors have already requested the return of more than half of Jet’s fleet of about 115 aircraft, with the carrier voluntarily returning some of those. Jet’s shares closed down 12 percent, having earlier fallen more than 20 percent to their lowest in a decade. Employees of the company have said they have not been paid for months and plan to take the airline to National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), a process allowed under Indian law.  “Right now we’re more worried about the bidding deadline,” said a Jet Airways pilot. “We will obviously have to take it to NCLT and (go through) with the proceedings,” he added.  As funds ran out, Jet also struggled to pay vendors and employees. “In the last four or five months, payments became highly erratic,” Vispi Patel, an executive at Weizmann Forex, which counts Jet as a client, said.  Patel said Jet had failed to respond to its calls and emails and as a result the FX company had reclaimed money from some forex cards issued to pilots and cabin crew for international trips. Sources told Reuters that Jet’s lenders had not yet made a decision on whether to push for bankruptcy, but industry experts said dragging the airline through the NCLT might be counter productive.  “If there are no bidders through this process, then the airline will shut,” analyst Vijayant Gupta of Edelweiss Securities said. “Lenders have no incentive to take Jet to the bankruptcy court because there are no hard assets to liquidate.” The Economic Times reported that Jet’s management has met executives from Mahindra, Adani, Tata group and Reliance Industries in the last two weeks regarding a rescue, but none of the conglomerates have responded positively. Those companies either did not respond to emails seeking comments, or declined to.

Last month, Kangana Ranaut’s sister Rangoli Chandel, made a personal attack at Alia Bhatt and her mother Soni Razdan for not holding Indian passports.“These non Indians who are living off this land, using and abusing its people and its resources, lying about intolerance and spreading hatred, time to think about their agenda and not to get carried away with their provocations,” her tweet read.

19526,India to seek Pakistan's blacklisting by terror finance watchdog,"Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has said India will request that Pakistan be blacklisted by Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the global money laundering and terror finance watchdog. Pakistan PM Imran Khan had said that blacklisting would likely result in sanctions. Pakistan has been on the FATF's ""grey list"" since June 2018, making it harder for it to access international markets.",Reuters,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India will ask the global money laundering and terror finance watchdog to put Pakistan on a blacklist of countries that fail to meet international standards in stopping financial crime, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said on Thursday. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) already has Pakistan on its “grey list” of countries with inadequate controls over curbing money laundering and terrorism financing. But India wants Pakistan blacklisted, which would likely result in sanctions, Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan said last month. “We want Pakistan downgraded on the FATF list,” Jaitley told reporters, adding that the Paris-based FATF was due to meet in mid-May and India would make its request then. The call came a day after India claimed a diplomatic victory with a U.N. Security Council committee blacklisting the founder of the Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) militant group, Masood Azhar. His group claimed responsibility for a February suicide bombing that killed at least 40 Indian paramilitary police in the Indian-controlled part of the disputed Kashmir region, an attack that brought the nuclear-armed neighbours to the brink of war.  Pakistan’s ally China had repeatedly opposed efforts at the United Nations by Western powers to directly sanction Azhar, even though the group had already been blacklisted by the U.N. Security Council in 2001. Azhar’s freedom within Pakistan has been a sore point in the relationship between Western countries and Pakistan, and has led to repeated accusations by India that Islamabad uses and harbours militant groups to further its foreign policy agenda. Pakistan denies such accusations. India’s foreign ministry welcomed the sanctioning of Azhar as “a step in the right direction to demonstrate the international community’s resolve to fight against terrorism and its enablers”. “The core issue is that he has been declared an international terrorist,” Jaitley said, referring to Azhar. “He and his country now face the consequences of that.”      In February, the Paris-based FATF had said that Pakistan “does not demonstrate a proper understanding” of terrorism financing risks posed by militant groups, including the JeM. The organisation can make recommendations to any of the countries that have signed a membership charter, as well as other nations, but it has no power to impose sanctions.

The plan is to stage the sit-in tomorrow at 11 a.m.“From being told to go on sick leave when you’re not sick, to having your reports taken away, we’re sick of retaliation,” Google employees tweeted via @GoogleWalkout. “Six months ago, we walked out. This time, we’re sitting in.”Google declined to comment on the sit-in, but pointed to its previous statement regarding retaliation:“We prohibit retaliation in the workplace and publicly share our very clear policy,” a Google spokesperson told TechCrunch. “To make sure that no complaint raised goes unheard at Google, we give employees multiple channels to report concerns, including anonymously, and investigate all allegations of retaliation.”This comes six months after 20,000 Google employees walked out following the company’s mishandling of sexual harassment allegations. Last week, two Google employees accused the company of retaliating against them for organizing the walkout, Wired first reported.Meredith Whittaker, the lead of Google’s Open Research and one of the organizers of the walkout, said her role was “changed dramatically.” Fellow walkout organizer Claire Stapleton said her manager told her she would be demoted and lose half of her reports.That was followed by an employee-led town hall meeting to hear from other employees who had faced retaliation at Google. Yesterday, Googlers publicly shared additional stories of retaliation on Medium. Here’s one:I reported my tech lead to my manager for sexual harassment, but my manager thought I was “overreacting.” I then reported my manager, as I could no longer feel comfortable working with this colleague every day while no action was being taken. The tech lead provided unsolicited feedback in my perf that took four months for the perf team to remove. The manager boxed me out and denied my promotion nomination by my peers. Eventually HR found there was retaliation but simply offered “coaching” to the teach lead and manager. I was asked to accept this. I refused. No additional actions were taken. They both still work at Google.In response, Google Global Director of Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Melonie Parker began publicly sharing the company’s workplace policies on harassment, discrimination and retaliation.

19547,EC notice to Rahul over 'PM Modi govt law to shoot tribals' claim,"After Congress President Rahul Gandhi claimed that PM Narendra Modi-led government enacted a new law which states that ""tribals can be shot"", the Election Commission sent him a notice for allegedly violating Model Code of Conduct. The leader has been given 48 hours to respond to the notice. Rahul had made the remarks during a rally in Madhya Pradesh's Shahdol.",The Quint,"The Election Commission on Wednesday, 1 May, issued a show-cause notice to Congress president Rahul Gandhi for his alleged remarks that the Narendra Modi government has enacted a new law which allows tribal to be shot at.Citing his speech made in Shahdol, Madhya Pradesh on April 23, the commission pointed at a provision of the model code which bars ""unverified"" allegations to be levelled against political opponents.Also Read : EC Gives PM Modi a Clean Chit for Latur Speech Invoking PulwamaTwo BJP workers had approached the EC with the complaint, following which a report was sought from MP poll authorities.According to a broad translation of the Hindi speech available on the internet, Gandhi had alleged: ""Narendra Modi government has made a new law for tribals in which there is a line that says tribals can be shot at...They snatch your land, take away your jungle and water and then say that tribals can be shot at.""(Hi there!

19555,HydÂ’s 400-yr-old Charminar suffers damage as part of minaret falls,"A part of the ornamental stucco work on one of the minarets of over 400-year-old Charminar in Hyderabad fell down on Wednesday. A video of the incident shows the fallen part lying on the base of the monument, near the stairs leading to the ticket counter. Police said that the part of the carving that has fallen was newly renovated.",The New Indian Express,"HYDERABAD: In a major embarrassment to the city, a chunk of lime plaster from one of the four minarets of the iconic Charminar fell down late on Wednesday. As though that wasn’t enough, the 500-year-old Mecca Masjid too stares at a grave mishap, with a newly-discovered structural crack.
As for Charminar, Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) officials said the portion fell due to ageing of the lime, coupled with the effect of unseasonal torrential rainfall with strong winds a few weeks back. They also confirmed that the damage was restricted to the lime plaster, and no structural damage was sustained.The incident happened at 11.30 pm on Wednesday, when a part of the ornamental stucco work of the minaret, measuring about 2.5 m by 0.8 m on the southwest side of the monument came crashing down. Thankfully, no one was injured.“The original plaster was replaced by the Nizam in 1924 at a cost of `1 lakh. Lime has a life of 700-800 years. We are now looking into analysing the materials used during the time of Asaf Jahis and comparing them with the original ones made during the time of Qutub Shahis,” superintending archaeologist of ASI-Hyderabad Milan Kumar Chauley said.“Also, from my experience, I’ve seen that it is very difficult for artisans to work at that height — 56 m. This keeps happening because during the time of Asaf Jahis, reinforcements were not used. People used bamboo or wooden sticks for support,” Chauley added.
Interestingly, the same minaret, on the southwestern side, suffered similar damage when a chunk of lime plaster fell in 2001. The ASI then  restored it using brick jelly lime in three layers. Since that technique had been successful till now, ASI officials on Thursday evening decided to use it again to restore the structure.Meanwhile in Mecca Masjid, the situation is getting graver by the day, with contractors questioning each other on the methodology being used to fix the 8-inch deep and 10-inch wide structural crack, which is at a pivotal place on the arch, which holds up a substantial part of the ceiling.And the sky comes falling down on ASIAs a portion of Charminar’s Southwest minaret fell off late on Wednesday, ASI officials scurried into action, taking exigency measures to prevent the damage from escalating; meanwhile, investigations are on and speculations on the reasons behind mishap are rife within the city’s conservation communityWith countless restoration works in line at Charminar, the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) is at its hapless best after it the jolt from Wednesday night, when a chunk of lime plaster from one of the monument’s minarets, detached itself from the structure.
Scurrying to action, starting at day break, ASI officials have implemented exigency measures so that the situation does not exacerbate further. Earlier in the day, Charminar was closed off to visitors but was reopened before noon. In the evening, Superintending Archaeologist Milan Kumar Chauley, who was in Delhi, returned to the city for a quick inspection of the site. Weather plays spoilsportA close look at the spot from where the lime chunks fell off, showed tiny, thread-like cracks. “When it rains, water seeps in through these cracks, making the portion heavier. For instance, if that portion was 1 kg in weight, after absorbing the water, it increases up to 5 kg,” said Chauley.A few weeks back, there were a series of thunderstorms that kicked the city out of balance. ASI officials have claimed that the thunderstorms played their part in intensifying these cracks. “On one particular day, the rain blew in from the north-east direction which meant that the south-west minaret took the direct brunt of the force of the gale,” they explained. Officials also said that they had discovered a hairline crack following the storm.Asaf Jahi minaret, not Qutub shahiBut can we blame everything on the winds? Not quite. In the 19th century, a lightning had struck the Charminar, damaging one if its minarets. Officials said that one of the minarets had even collapsed and rebuilt by the Asaf Jahis. This was the same south-west minaret, from which the lime plaster fell off in 2001, and the same one from which it fell on Wednesday night, Chauley said. “In 1924, the entire monument was re-plastered by the Nizams using lime plaster. It is important to note that with the advent of technology, sometimes it is not possible to replicate the original lime mortar completely. For instance, lime mortar needs country eggs and not normal eggs. Where do you get country eggs now?” Chauley explained while adding that there was a need for analysis between the mortar used during the Qutub Shahi era and the new one. ‘No surity that it won’t happen again’During the inspection on Wednesday evening, a number of cracks were discovered, which were not observed earlier -- on small turrets, on the flooring of the mosque above Charminar and in myriad other places. “No one can assure you, that a similar thing would not happen again. You never know what’s going on beneath those cracks. And these things keep on happening,” he added. 
The majority of the extent of ASI’s work on Charminar has been to apply sibara coating and take on minor repair works. To re-plaster the whole monument again, it would need considerable investment, in terms of time and money -- both of which the ASI is in short supply of.",http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/hyderabad/2019/may/02/video--charminar-minaret-falls-down-no-injuries-reported-1971767.html?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

The dossier states that JeM has intensified terrorist operations against India and broadened its operational focus by joining Afghan Taliban in attacks against Afghanistan.",ANI,"By Ajit DubeyNew Delhi (India), May 1 (ANI): Designated as a global terrorist by the United Nations, Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) chief and Pulwama terror attack mastermind Masood Azhar has been shifted to a safe house in Islamabad from his residence in Bahawalpur by Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), sources have said. A dossier prepared by the government on the global terrorist which has also been shared with the international community, says that the Azhar was “put under house arrest at Markaz Subhan Allah in Bahawalpur, post ‘Balakot Attack’ (26.02.2019) and has been recently shifted to a Safe House in Islamabad.”Pakistan has been hiding Azhar and his relatives from the public glare ever since he carried out Pulwama attack against CRPF personnel in February this year in which 40 jawans were killed and has been hiding fearing a direct Indian strike on him.In the dossier, sources said Jaish head has not only intensified terrorist operations against the Indian government, security forces and civilians in Jammu and Kashmir but has also broadened Jaish’s operational focus by joining Afghan Taliban in attacks against government and coalition forces in Afghanistan.“JeM has undertaken a recruitment drive through its students and charity fronts. Talba Al-Murabitoon (Students Movement for Ideological and Geographical Defence of Islam and Pakistan), along with other wings such as Al Rehmat Trust and Preaching Wing, regularly organises events in close coordination in order to urge people to wage Jehad according to Sunnat and Shariah and support their action against India,” the dossier says. Azhar also decides on the deployment of terrorists along with his brother and Operational Commander of JeM, Mufti Abdul Rauf Asghar. On their direction and supervision, ‘high-value operatives,’ particularly trained terrorists belonging to their family are infiltrated into J&K to conduct spectacular terror attacks. “The killings of such high-value targets by Indian Security Forces are then projected as “Shahadat” and leveraged for aggressive recruitment and fund collection activities in Pakistan and PoJK. Pamphlets, books dedicated to killed terrorists, photos, posts over social media, speeches of JeM functionaries and audio messages are released to further intensify recruitment and to radicalize for terror operations,” sources said. Maulana Masood Azhar is also head of the swimming course projected by JeM as ‘Samundari Jehad,’ which has been started at JeM’s Markaz Subhanallah in Bahawalpur, Punjab, during mid-2018. This training has also been incorporated in JeM’s curriculum of advanced training towards its preparation to gain maritime capability in the medium to long run, to undertake sea/river-based operations.Sources said Prime Minister Narendra Modi and External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj played a key role in getting Masood Azhar designated as a global terrorist by the United Nations Security Council.To convince China and Bring them on board with the demand, National Security Advisor Ajit Doval was constantly in touch with his counterpart in Beijing. The NSA also held several discussions with his American counterpart to constantly push the issue, they said.

19565,Don't believe Cong fielded weak candidates anywhere: Akhilesh,"Refuting Priyanka Gandhi Vadra's claim that Congress had chosen candidates ""carefully"" for the UP LS polls to cut into BJP's vote share and not into the SP-BSP-RLD alliance's votes, SP chief Akhilesh Yadav said, ""I cannot believe in these types of statements."" Akhilesh added, ""I do not believe that the Congress has fielded weak candidates anywhere. No party does it.""",ANI,"Lucknow (Uttar Pradesh) [India], May 2 (ANI): Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra’s claim to have fielded weak candidates to eat into BJP’s vote share in the Lok Sabha poll in the state has not cut any ice with SP chief Akhilesh Yadav, who sees her statement as an “excuse” since the “people are not with them"".“I cannot believe in these types of statements. I do not believe that the Congress has fielded weak candidates anywhere. No party does it. People are not with them. That is why they are making excuses,” Yadav told ANI in an exclusive interview.Priyanka on Wednesday had said in Raebareli that her party had fielded some candidates in UP with an aim to cut into BJP’s vote share. “Congress will win on the seats where our candidates are strong. Where our candidates are slightly lightweight, they will cut into BJP’s vote share,” she told media persons.When asked about political analysts’ claim that the coalition is the ‘Team B’ of the Congress, Yadav, also former UP chief minister, claimed that there was no difference between the BJP and the grand old party.“There is no difference between the BJP and the Congress. The Congress wants to benefit the BJP,” he said.“Who taught the central agencies to intimidate Opposition leaders? The BJP has learnt to misuse the Enforcement Directorate, Central Bureau of Investigation and other agencies against leaders in opposition from the Congress,” he said.“The person who filed PILs against Netaji (Mulayam Singh Yadav) and me was present at the nomination of Lucknow Congress candidate,” he said.He also debunked Congress president Rahul Gandhi’s claim that BJP controls the SP and the BSP. “No one controls us. We are political parties. It is the SP, BSP and RLD alliance in UP that is poised to give a setback to the ruling party,” Yadav said.He termed SP-BSP-RLD alliance as the glue that is connected to the people on the ground. “Our alliance will stop the bad policies of the BJP.”Exuding confidence that the alliance would bag the maximum number of seats in the state where 80 seats are at stake, Yadav said: “It is one of the reasons that the BJP leaders do not talk about development in their rallies and seek to divert the people’s attention.”“The alliances in several states have choices but the BJP does not have any other leader. Our alliance wants to give India a new Prime Minister. My party will decide about the PM when the final seat tally is out,” he said, when asked who will be the prime minister if the BJP does not come to power.Asked if his father and former Defence Minister Mulayam Singh Yadav will be a prime ministerial candidate, Yadav said: “It will be good if Netaji gets the honour (to be the PM) but I feel he is probably not in the prime ministerial race.”When asked about his national ambition, the 45-year-old leader said that he only wants his party to contribute in the new government at the Centre and made it clear that he is focusing at the Assembly elections, which are due in 2022.“I want to appeal to the people of UP to give us one more chance to further our programmes which has been stalled,” he said.“However, I want to increase the number of SP’s MPs in the Lok Sabha. I want to be among those who want to make a new Prime Minister. I want UP to contribute in the next government formation.”When asked whether he would want her wife Dimple Yadav to be a part of a non-BJP government at the Centre, Yadav said: “I want her to win with a good margin of votes first because Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and the DGP of the state want to ensure that she loses.”When asked why he is vehemently critical to Prime Minister Modi while his father is comfortable with him, Yadav said: “Netaji is from a generation when leaders used to respect other leaders irrespective of their party lines. But the behaviour of the BJP leaders towards others is not good.”It is worth mentioning that Mulayam Singh had left all surprised after he sought another term for Prime Minister Modi in February this year. “I wish that PM Modi, you should become the prime minister again,” he had said in his intervention in the last sitting of the Lok Sabha.Talking about the way the nomination of Tej Bahadur Yadav was rejected in Varanasi, he criticised Returning Officer (RO) Surendra Singh for not giving adequate time to his party candidate and former BSF constable Tej Bahadur Yadav to submit a document.“If the DM had any objections, he should have raised when he filed his nomination papers the first time. Had he point out the issue then, he would have produced the document timely. I believe the Supreme Court will deliver him justice,” he said.Talking about controversial remarks made by his senior party leader Azam Khan about Jaya Prada, Yadav defended him saying that sometimes even his legitimate remarks are taken wrongly and maintained that he shares good relation with Azam Khan like his father Mulayam Singh Yadav.Yadav said: “He speaks directly. Sometimes even his legitimate remarks are seen in a bad light. He is as close to me as he is to Neta ji.”The former Chief Minister, however, declined to comment on the family feud which led to his uncle Shivpal Singh Yadav floating a new party.“It is difficult to say whether or not we will unite in the future but at least the people want to know who was at fault,” he said.

""I don't see anything sinister with what Paddy wrote...As a driven individual I've tried to raise bar for myself alone,"" he added. ""I wanted myself and Indian team to be the best in the world,"" he further said.",CricTracker,"Celebrity autobiographies are amazing insights into the people’s mind who write it. They share everything that the players can’t speak about in public and give personal opinions on people, who they need to be cordial with in real life. One such autobiography, the ‘The Barefoot Coach’ by Rajasthan Royals’ coach Paddy Upton caused furore over his comments on former India and KKR captain Gautam Gambhir.In his book, Upton detailing reveals how insecure and vulnerable was Gautam Gambhir when it comes to his cricket during his stint in the Indian Premier League and how the former Kolkata Knight Riders captain was the most negative person he had met and worked with. Upton had worked with the Indian team as the mental conditioning coach during Gambhir’s tenure on the national side.AdvertisementGautam Gambhir was recently asked about the comments made by Upton in his book about him and mentioned that he has no ill feeling about Upton, though he would have liked if the coach had highlight other characteristics of him in the book as well.“I don’t see anything sinister with what Paddy wrote. He is a top guy and I see this as his personal opinion. He just missed two important things: firstly, he didn’t state all the other facts and secondly, he failed to explain the perspective. Anyone would like to have a guy who is not satisfied with his current achievements. So, in short, I wasn’t satisfied with a 100 and wanted to have more,” Gambhir was quoted as saying by India Today.In his book, Upton wrote: “I did some of my best and least effective mental conditioning work with Gambhir, the International Test Cricketer of the Year in 2009. He would be in mental agony about losing his wicket and about needing to fix things. He was so riddled with insecurities, doubts, and vulnerabilities. He was one of the most negative people I have ever worked with.”The 2007 World T20 and 2011 World Cup winner said in reply that even Sir Don Bradman would have liked to end with a career average of over 100 in Tests and Tendulkar would have wishes one more World Cup win; one always strives for higher achievements. “I am certain my dear friend Paddy won’t have termed these desires as “negative” or “weak”. To aspire to excel is the very basis of playing the sport for me and thank Heavens it never changed for me,” Gambhir further said.",https://www.crictracker.com/gautam-gambhir-responds-to-paddy-uptons-most-negative-comment-says-he-is-not-hurt/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

19577,"Eating more rice could prevent obesity, study suggests","Obesity levels are substantially lower in countries that consume high amounts of rice (150g/day/person) than countries with lower rice intake (14g), as per a study comprising 136 countries. Researchers accounted for factors like total energy consumption, smoking, and GDP per capita. Scientists estimate that increasing average rice consumption by a quarter of a cup could reduce worldwide obesity by 1%.",ANI,"Washington D.C. [USA], May 1 (ANI): Obesity levels are substantially lower in countries that consume high amounts of rice, while counties with lower average rice intake have higher obesity levels, recent findings suggest.The link between rice intake and obesity persisted even after taking into account other lifestyle and socioeconomic risk factors including total energy consumption, education, smoking, gross domestic product per capita, and health expenditure.The researchers estimate that even a modest increase in average rice consumption could reduce the worldwide prevalence of obesity by 1%.""The observed associations suggest that the obesity rate is low in countries that eat rice as a staple food. Therefore, Japanese food or an Asian-food-style diet based on rice may help prevent obesity. Given the rising levels of obesity worldwide, eating more rice should be recommended to protect against obesity even in western countries,” said Tomoko Imai, lead researcher of the study discussed in European Congress on Obesity meeting.People who eat higher levels of dietary fibre and whole grains have lower body weight and cholesterol, and lower rates of non-communicable diseases compared with people with lower intakes. However, the effect of rice consumption on obesity is unclear.To better understand the link between the two, Imai and colleagues examined rice (all rice products including white rice, brown rice, rice flour) relative consumption and energy consumption in the diets of 136 countries with populations of more than 1 million, using data from the UN Food and Agriculture Organization.These data were analysed together with estimates of obesity prevalence, the average number of years spent in education, percentage of the population over 65 years old, gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, and health expenditure. Countries were categorised into low and high consumption groups.Their analysis showed that total energy consumed, smoking rates, obesity levels, percentage of population over 65 years old, GDP, education, and health expenditure were significantly lower in countries that consumed high levels of rice, including as Bangladesh (ranked 1st; 473 g/day/person), Lao (2nd; 443) Cambodia (3rd; 438), Vietnam (4th; 398), and Indonesia (5th; 361), compared to countries with lower rice intake including France (ranked 99th; 15 g/day/person), the UK (89th; 19), the USA (87th; 19), Spain (81st ; 22), Canada (77th; 24), Australia (67th; 32).Even after taking into account and adjusting for these known risk factors, an inverse association was observed between rice consumption and rates of obesity--suggesting that higher intakes of rice could provide even greater protection.According to the researchers, eating rice seems to protect against weight gain. It's possible that the fibre, nutrients, and plant compounds found in whole grains may increase feelings of fullness and prevent overeating.""Rice is also low in fat and has a relatively low postprandial blood glucose level which suppresses insulin secretion. However, there are also reports that people who overeat rice are more likely to develop metabolic syndrome and diabetes. Therefore, an appropriate amount of rice intake may prevent obesity"", said Imai.Although the research does not establish a cause-and-effect relationship between country-level rice consumption and obesity, the researchers say that it should be investigated further.Whilst a limitation of cross-sectional studies is the risk of identifying false associations as a result of confounding factors, the association identified between rice consumption and obesity remained even after adjusting for various lifestyle and socioeconomic risk factors.

She was named as Queen Suthida three days before his scheduled coronation. This is the fourth marriage of the Thai King, who has five sons and two daughters from his previous marriages.",Reuters,"BANGKOK (Reuters) - Just days before his official coronation, Thailand’s King Maha Vajiralongkorn on Wednesday married the deputy head of his personal guard force and gave her the title Queen Suthida. The surprise announcement was carried in the Royal Gazette, and footage from Wednesday’s wedding ceremony was later shown on the nightly Royal News segment aired on all Thai television channels.  Vajiralongkorn, 66, also known by the title King Rama X, became constitutional monarch after the death of his revered father, King Bhumibol Adulyadej, in October 2016, after 70 years on the throne. He is due to be officially crowned in elaborate Buddhist and Brahmin ceremonies on Saturday, followed by a procession through Bangkok the next day. In 2014, Vajiralongkorn appointed Suthida Tidjai, a former flight attendant for Thai Airways, as a deputy commander of his bodyguard unit. Some royal observers and foreign media had linked Suthida romantically with the king, but the palace had previously never acknowledged a relationship between them. The king made Suthida a full general in the Royal Thai Army in December 2016, and the deputy commander of the king’s personal guard in 2017. He also made her a Thanpuying, a royal title meaning Lady. Among the dignitaries at the wedding were Prayuth Chan-ocha, the leader of the military junta that has run Thailand since a 2014 army coup, as well as other members of the royal family and palace advisers, the wedding footage showed.  Vajiralongkorn has previously been married and divorced three times and has seven children. While the king took the throne after the death of his father, his formal coronation follows a mourning period for King Bhumibol, whose royal cremation was held a year after his death.

Priyanka said she's working to ""strengthen"" Congress in UP.",India.com,"The Congress is not at all cutting into votes of the SP-BSP-RLD alliance in Uttar Pradesh as the party has fielded candidates either with prospects of victory or having potential to damage BJP’s chances in the state, Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said on Wednesday.Asked whether she was afraid of contesting against Prime Minister Narendra Modi from Varanasi, Priyanka said she was not scared at all and that she joined politics “for good”.“If Priyanka Gandhi gets scared, she will sit at home and not do politics. I am in politics for good and will be there,” she said.The Congress general secretary in-charge of eastern Uttar Pradesh also hit out at the BJP for what she called its “obsession” with the Gandhi family when the focus should be on solving people’s problems.On the political landscape in Uttar Pradesh, Priyanka said, “We have carefully chosen candidates so that either Congress wins or they cut into BJP’s votes. Congress is not at all cutting into votes of the ‘UP gathbandhan’.”Priyanka was talking to the media during her campaign trail in Amethi where her brother Rahul Gandhi is seeking re-election.Asked whether Rahul Gandhi will become the prime minister, Priyanka said, “My brother will prove to be a good prime minister. Whether he will become the prime minister or not, the public has to decide.”The Samajwadi Party (SP), Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and the Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) forged an alliance months before the Lok Sabha polls, but kept out the Congress as there was no agreement on seat-sharing.According to political observers, the anti-BJP vote could get split between the Congress and the UP alliance, benefitting BJP.“This is not a preparation for (assembly polls) in UP in 2022. This is about defeating BJP in 2019,” she said, adding, “Congress party is weak in UP we need to strengthen it here. I am working towards it.”Priyanka said there was no leader like her brother Rahul Gandhi as he listens to people and tries to resolve their problems.“BJP is obsessed with Gandhi family. When we come here we do not talk about our family. We talk about problems of people, but they target our family in half of their speeches,” said Priyanka.On the decision of her not being fielded from Varanasi, she said if she had contested from the temple town, she would have been confined to only one constituency.“I am not dejected that I am not contesting from Varanasi. I wanted to campaign and strengthen Congress in eastern Uttar Pradesh. Had I contested from Varanasi I would have got confined to Varanasi alone and would not have been able to work for strengthening the party,” she said.“There is a lot of work to do in eastern Uttar Pradesh and we have to defeat the BJP in Uttar Pradesh and strengthen the Congress,” she said.The Congress fielded Ajay Rai from Varanasi, ending weeks of speculations that the constituency may witness a blockbuster contest between Modi and Priyanka.“I am not fighting elections or campaigning for myself…I have a lot of work to do here and every Congress candidate wants me to campaign for them. I had said in the beginning that if the party wants me to contest (from Varanasi), then I am ready and would go by the party’s decision,” she added.Training her guns on the BJP, Priyanka alleged that the government at the Centre has not given “nyay” (justice) to people.“People are harassed. This government has lost the trust of the people who voted them on hopes which have been dashed,” she added.“You have to understand their niyat (intention) and neeti (policy). They have done nothing to solve the menace of stray cattle. Gaushalas are yet to be set up,” she said.Priyanka also took a swipe at government over the PM Kisan Samman Nidhi Yojana, under which a farmer will get Rs 6,000 annually, saying it’s “a kisan apman (insult) yojana”.The Congress general secretary attacked Union minister and BJP candidate from Amethi constituency Smriti Irani.“By distributing shoes, she has insulted people of Amethi…They say that there is parivarwaad (dynastic politics), but this is the love of the people of Amethi, which our family is getting…When I was 12-year-old, I had seen barren land, and I remember my father seeking your support, and today there is greenery,” she said and referred to various works done by her father and former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and by her brother Rahul Gandhi.The Salon assembly segment in Rae Bareli district falls under the Amethi parliamentary constituency.

PM had said that chanting 'Vande Mataram' is like a life force.",The Financial Express,"Lok Sabha Election 2019:  A peculiar incident during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s election rally in Bihar’s Darbhanga district on April 25 has caught the eye of political watchers. Modi ended his speech, heavy on nationalism and the government’s actions against Pakistan-sponsored terror, also touched upon an issue that came into focus just days ahead of the Prime Minister’s visit.Lok Sabha Election 2019: Full CoverageChanting Vande Mataram has been a bone of contention between two groups of thought ever since the Modi government came to power. While the BJP and its leaders believe that nobody should have a problem in saying Vande Mataram, the other side believes otherwise. Rashtriya Janata Dal leader and Grand Alliance candidate from Bihar, Abdul Bari Siddiqui, had said in a television interview that while he had no issues with saying Bharat Mata Ki Jai, chanting Vande Mataram was against his beliefs.Addressing the rally, the Prime Minister picked on Siddiqui’s remark and said at the rally that those who have problems with chanting Vande Mataram must be defeated and their deposits forfeited. Ending the rally, Modi asked the crowds to hold up their fists and join him in chanting Vande Mataram. All on stage followed suit, except Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar. Will Sanghis & Bhakts call @NitishKumar Anti National & say Bharat mein Rahnaa hai to …… bolna https://t.co/IyOFvzK96L— Asaduddin Owaisi (@asadowaisi) May 1, 2019As crowds and leaders including LJP’s Ram Vilas Paswan, stood up and joined Modi in Vande Mataram chants, visuals of a silent Nitish Kumar who remained seated till Modi left the podium were difficult to miss even for the ordinary eye.What piques interest in Nitish’s odd behaviour is the history that he shares with Modi much before he became Prime Minister. Having dislodged Lalu Yadav from power in Bihar and his carefully cultivated image of ‘Sushasan Babu’, Nitish had been positioned as a face who could one day become prime minister. Rapid infrastructural development coupled with a drop in crime only strengthened his image.Crucially, Nitish Kumar remained a staunch opposer to Modi who was seen as a staunch Hindutva proponent for long and went on to cut ties with the BJP after Modi was chosen as the saffron party’s PM face. However, a series of developments later, Nitish returned to the NDA fold, breaking ties with RJD’s Lalu Yadav and dislodging the party from power once again to form a government with the BJP in Bihar. During the 2014 general elections that Nitish’s JD(U) contested alone and ended up winning just two of the 40 Lok Sabha seats.Amid the twists and turns that unfolded in the last five years, rarely had Nitish put across his differences with the BJP and Modi in the manner that he put on public display last week. Call it subtle political messaging, a sign of things to come or plain lack of enthusiasm, Nitish Kumar’s silence in an atmosphere of enthusiasm is striking to say the least.Get live Stock Prices from BSE and NSE and latest NAV, portfolio of Mutual Funds, calculate your tax by Income Tax Calculator, know market’s Top Gainers, Top Losers & Best Equity Funds.

19616,Reliance Jio to launch 'Super App' with 100 services: Report,Reliance Jio is reportedly aiming to launch a Â‘Super AppÂ’ that will provide over 100 services in one platform. The report said the app will let users order goods and services on it and pay bills using in-app payment services. Reports added that launching the app will put Reliance in a position to replicate China's WeChat in India.,Entrackr,"Mukesh Ambani-led RIL has been proactively working towards launching online-to-offline (O2O) retail plans that will include providing over 100 services in one app.On the lines of Tencent-owned WeChat model, Reliance is aiming to launch ‘Super App’ that will allow its users to order goods and services on its platform and pay bills using its in-app payment services.The company is working to create a hybrid ecosystem, where customers would be able to buy online as well as shop offline. It plans to leverage its 300 million plus new mobile phone users.A Super App will help Jio users in all their digital commerce requirement, said Busines Standard report quoting a source close to the development.RIL might just do what Wechat has done in China. However, in India, several marketplaces and wallet firms in the past have tried to replicate the WeChat model. But none of them has successfully been able to do it.Whether it was Snapdeal or Flipkart or Paytm or Hike, they all reportedly wanted to create WeChat-clone in the country, but could not get a breakthrough and ultimately dropped the idea.Somehow experts observing the space, think that Ambani-led firm has the potential to replicate Wechat.The company has all the products, supply chains, tech team, internet user base, and logistics capability to back it up to its plan. And every day it has been inching closer to realise its plan to be a one-stop solution for everything.Early this month, RIL started withdrawing its products such as clothes, shoes including fashion and lifestyle products from its rival marketplaces like Amazon and Flipkart. The move is largely in sync to RIL’s aims to create exclusivity for its brands and launch of O2O platform.The firm plans to generate half of the group’s revenue from the consumer businesses in the next decade. At present, about 80 % of the group’s sales come from its traditional oil and gas business.  Entrackr‘s queries, seeking detail on this, to Reliance are yet to elicit a response.Meanwhile, in 2018, Ambani had said that he sees its biggest growth opportunity in creating a hybrid, online-to-offline new commerce platform as it aims to redefine retail in India.RIL has been working with kiranas stores and consumer brands to create an operational model for the same. To strengthen its play for e-commerce, RIL had acquired Haptik and Fynd. Entrackr had exclusively reported about Fynd acquisition by RIL.Scouting to place its bet on e-commerce in India after exiting from Flipkart, Softbank reportedly is planning to invest about $2-3 billion in Jio. If it goes as per the report, this will further equip Reliance to do what no marketplaces and online payment firms have been able to do in India.",https://entrackr.com/2019/04/reliance-jio-launch-super-app/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

19633,"NASA was sold faulty rocket parts for 20 years, lost $700 million","A NASA investigation has found the space agency lost $700 million in failed missions as an Oregon-based aluminium supplier Sapa Profiles falsified certifications for nearly two decades. NASA said its 2009 and 2011 missions failed because the fairing, material which covers the satellites, failed to separate on command. The company has agreed to pay $46 million in fines.",Engadget,"When the launch of NASA's Orbiting Carbon Observatory and Glory missions failed in 2009 and 2011, the agency said it was because their launch vehicle malfunctioned. The clamshell structure (called fairing) encapsulating the satellites as they traveled aboard Orbital ATK's Taurus XL rocket failed to separate on command. Now, a NASA Launch Services Program (LSP) investigation has revealed that the malfunction was caused by faulty aluminum materials. More importantly, the probe blew a 19-year fraud scheme perpetrated by Oregon aluminum extrusion manufacturer Sapa Profiles, Inc., which Orbital ATK fell victim to, wide open.LSP, along with NASA's Office of the Inspector General and the US Department of Justice, have discovered the Sapa Profiles falsified critical tests on the aluminum it sold. For almost two decades, employees would doctor failing numbers or violate other testing standards, such as increasing the speed of testing machines or using sample sizes that didn't meet specifications. They'd then provide clients, including government contractors, with falsified certifications. SPI itself was motivated by profits and the need to conceal the inconsistent quality of its aluminum products, while its employees were motivated by production-based bonuses.Jim Norman, NASA's director for Launch Services at NASA Headquarters in Washington, explains why suppliers' integrity is incredibly important for the agency's missions:""NASA relies on the integrity of our industry throughout the supply chain. While we do perform our own testing, NASA is not able to retest every single component. That is why we require and pay for certain components to be tested and certified by the supplier. When testing results are altered and certifications are provided falsely, missions fail. In our case, the Taurus XLs that failed for the OCO and Glory missions resulted in the loss of more than $700 million, and years of people's scientific work. It is critical that we are able to trust our industry to produce, test and certify materials in accordance with the standards we require. In this case, our trust was severely violated.""The company, now known as Hydro Extrusion Portland, Inc., has agreed to pay NASA, the DOJ and other entities $46 million. It's a tiny fraction of the $700 million NASA lost from the failed missions, but at least officials were able to hold SPI accountable for its actions. Sapa Profiles/Hydro Extrusion was also suspended from government contracting on September 30th, 2015, and it can no longer do business with the federal government.VideoPresenter: Chris VelazcoScript: Chris VelazcoScript Editor: Dana WollmanEditor: Chris SchodtProducer & Camera: Michael Morris",https://www.engadget.com/2019/05/01/nasa-aluminum-fraud-scheme-probe/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

She returned in July and sent her a notice of divorce to him through her lawyer, the daily reported.They later decided to give their relationship another chance after she visited Tiwari at the Max Hospital where he was admitted for a heart condition. Despite the two trying to reconcile, she said that ""living with Rohit and his family made me sick."" She also accused her mother-in-law, Ujjwala Singh, to be ""demanding, interfering and dominating."" Shukla claimed, ""I could not even change the bedroom curtain because she didn't want to."" Police also said that at the same time Shukla had discovered that Rohit's father had not bequeathed any property to him, and the Defence COlony house where they resided was owned by her mother-in-law. As per the report, the police said that Shukla was aware of what she had done. When asked about her motive to kill Tiwari, Shukla reportedly said, ""I killed Rohit because he was cruel, unreasonable and did not love me. We always fought about his affair but instead of relenting, he even began boasting about it.""On the intervening night of April 15 and April 16, Shukla killed her husband by strangulating him in his room and smothered him with a pillow after the two had a heated debate about his relations with the woman relative. Rohit Shekhar Tiwari was the son of ND Tiwari, veteran Congress leader and former CM of Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand. Rohit had fought a six-year long protracted legal battle to prove that he was ND Tiwari’s biological son.

19648,Julian Assange jailed for 50 weeks in UK for skipping bail 7yrs ago,WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange was sentenced to 50 weeks in prison in the UK on Wednesday for skipping bail in 2012 after an extradition order to Sweden over an allegation of rape. Assange was arrested by the UK from Ecuador's embassy last month after the country revoked his asylum. He was also arrested on an extradition request by the US.,Reuters,"LONDON (Reuters) - WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange was sentenced to 50 weeks in prison by a British court on Wednesday for skipping bail when he holed up in Ecuador’s London embassy for seven years until police dragged him out last month. Assange sought refuge in the embassy in June 2012 to avoid an extradition order to Sweden over an allegation of rape, which he denies.  His lawyer argued it was an act of desperation to avoid being passed to the United States to face action over the release of thousands of secret U.S. diplomatic cables. Many of the documents related to wars, national security and other issues, and some were often highly critical appraisals of world leaders such Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Saudi royal family. The United States has charged him with conspiracy and seeks his extradition.   But handing down what was nearly the maximum possible sentence, Judge Deborah Taylor told Assange he had exploited his privileged position to flout the law and express his disdain for British justice. “Whilst you may have had fears as to what may happen to you, nonetheless you had a choice,” Taylor told Assange, dressed in a black jacket and gray sweatshirt, at Southwark Crown Court.  “It is difficult to envisage a more serious example of this offence.” Assange made international headlines in early 2010 when WikiLeaks published a classified U.S. military video showing a 2007 attack by Apache helicopters in Baghdad that killed a dozen people, including two Reuters news staff. To some, Assange is a hero for exposing what supporters cast as abuse of power by modern states and for championing free speech. But to others, he is a dangerous rebel who has undermined U.S. security. After his sentence was announced, supporters in the public gallery got to their feet to cheer him, before raising their arms and chanting “shame on you” to the court. The case in Britain arose after Australian-born Assange, 47, was accused by two Swedish women of sexual assault and rape in 2010. Assange fought through the courts to get an extradition order and the preliminary investigation dropped. He fled to Ecuador’s embassy in June 2012 after exhausting all legal options and was granted asylum two months later. The Swedish allegations were dropped in 2017, but authorities there might revive them. Just hours after police finally removed from the Ecuadorean embassy in London on April 11, U.S. prosecutors said they had charged Assange with conspiracy in trying to access a classified U.S. government computer. He was convicted on the charge of jumping bail the same day. In a letter read out at the hearing in London, Assange said he regretted how matters how panned out.  “I apologize unreservedly to those who consider that I have disrespected them by the way I have pursued my case. This is not what I wanted or intended,” Assange said in the letter to the judge read out by his lawyer, Mark Summers.  “I found myself struggling with terrifying circumstances for which neither I nor those from whom I sought advice could work out any remedy. I did what I thought at the time was the best.”  Summers told the court that Assange had “strongly held fears” in 2012 that he would be sent from Sweden to the United States and ultimately to the Guantanamo Bay detention center in a U.S. naval base in Cuba. Summers cited the arrest and treatment of Chelsea Manning, a U.S. Army soldier who served seven years in military prison for leaking classified data while she was working as an intelligence analyst in Iraq. Assange’s lawyer said Manning, who is transgender, had been subjected to sleep deprivation and forced to parade naked in front of military personnel. Summers said the fact Assange chose indefinite detention in small rooms at the Ecuadorean Embassy, in a state of depression and pain for various medical ailments, rather than spend 12 months in a British jail, showed the extent of his fears.  But Judge Taylor rejected the arguments, saying they offered limited mitigation for his actions and that it had cost British taxpayers 16 million pounds ($21 million) to ensure he was arrested when he left the embassy. The sentence does not end British legal proceedings. On Thursday, there will be hearing in another London court as part of a U.S. extradition case. “Tomorrow...is the start of the big and most important fight,” Kristinn Hrafnsson from WikiLeaks said outside court. “What is at stake there? It could be a question of life and death for Mr Assange.” Reporting by Michael Holden; Editing by Guy Faulconbridge and Alison Williams",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-wikileaks-assange/julian-assange-sentenced-to-50-weeks-in-british-jail-for-skipping-bail-idUSKCN1S73H9?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

The editorial piece said that the ban on the face veil is as necessary as the surgical strikes and added that PM Narendra Modi needs to show his courage to go forward with the ban.“It has happened in Raavan’s Lanka. When will it happen in Ram’s Ayodhya? We ask this question to the PM as he is scheduled to visit Ayodhya on Wednesday,” read the editorial.To support its demand for the ban, the Shiv Sena cited examples of Britain, Australia and France, where it said the governments have made face veils illegal.BJP, on the other hand, rejected the demand. Arguing that Sri Lanka implemented the ban because of the scale of the Easter bombings, party spokesperson GVL Narasimha Rao told news agency ANI that the country is safe under PM Narendra Modi’s leadership.“There is a zero tolerance policy towards terrorism and the country is safe, there is no need for any bans,” Rao added.However, Shiv Sena’s proposal found backing from the saffron party’s Bhopal candidate Pragya Thakur.“Whatever is required to ensure national security must be done. Every religion should keep the nation first. A man was caught in some country in a Burqa. Even at the airport, you have to remove the Burqa. So, where the security of the country is concerned, it should be done,” Thakur was quoted as saying by News18.In an appeal to the Muslim community, Thakur said that they should implement their traditions by keeping the country’s interest as paramount and also decide for themselves if in places where security of the country is concerned, the tradition of law and security of the country should come first and foremost.Sri Lankan President, Maithripala Sirisena, issued the order of banning the face veil on monday. However, calling it an issue of national security, the order refrained from mentioning any particular community as the country deals with radical Islamic outfits within its borders and ISIS which owned responsibility for the ghastly attack.Get live Stock Prices from BSE and NSE and latest NAV, portfolio of Mutual Funds, calculate your tax by Income Tax Calculator, know market’s Top Gainers, Top Losers & Best Equity Funds.

19662,US sanctions on Iran will have direct impact on India: Ambassador,"India's ambassador to the US Harsh Vardhan Shringla on Tuesday said that Donald Trump's efforts to sink Iran's oil exports to zero will have a direct impact on India. US sanctions on Iran could increase oil prices and inflation that could affect the common person in India, Shringla said. He added many Indian refineries are calibrated to process Iranian oil.",Reuters,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. sanctions on Iran could boost oil prices and inflation to a point that hurts the common person in India, the country’s ambassador to the United States said on Tuesday, after the Trump administration said it would end waivers for Iran’s oil buyers. President Donald Trump’s efforts to sink Iran’s oil exports to zero  will have a direct impact on India, the largest buyer of the oil after China, Harsh Vardhan Shringla, the ambassador, said at a Carnegie Endowment event. “We are apprehensive that that impact can translate into inflation, (and) higher oil prices,” that could affect the common person in India, Shringla said. Trump’s sanctions on Iran are intended to curb its nuclear and ballistic missile programme and reduce its influence in Syria, Yemen and other countries in the Middle East.  Many of India’s oil refineries are calibrated to process crude oil from Iran and “it is not possible to suddenly convert those refineries (to run )some other form of crude,” Shringla said. Cutting off sales of oil from Iran, with which India has long had business and cultural relations, raises questions about long-term agreements on pricing and quality in the oil business, he said. The Trump administration surprised Iran’s oil customers, including India, China and Turkey, last week by saying no waivers on the sanctions would be granted after May 1, ending six months of exceptions to the sanctions for reductions in purchases. Trump reimposed the sanctions last year after removing Washington from a 2015 international pact with Tehran designed to curb its nuclear programme.  India’s Petroleum and Natural Gas Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said last week that India will get additional supplies from other major oil-producing countries to compensate for the loss of Iranian crude.  But U.S.-based critics of Trump’s sanctions have said that over the long term even U.S. allies will tire of having to comply with the measures and that smuggling of the oil could eventually rise. Shringla, who became ambassador in January after a diplomatic career of 35 years, said India understands Washington has issues with Iran. But excessive use of sanctions can at a certain stage become counterproductive, especially when administered by one country alone, and “affect friend and foe alike,” he said.

19666,Facebook Dating to add 'Secret Crush' feature to match friends,"Facebook announced a new 'Secret Crush' feature to its text-only dating service that lets users choose up to nine Facebook friends they are romantically interested in. If a friend, who uses Dating, also adds the user as a Secret Crush, it will result in a match. Dating, which previously only let users match with non-friends, is currently unavailable in India.",TechCrunch,"Facebook  built Dating to be privacy-safe, hoping to avoid the awkwardness of friends or family checking out your romance profile. But now Facebook has found a way to let you silently express your affection for a friend without them knowing unless they reciprocate.Facebook announced today at its F8 conference that Dating is opening in 14 more countries, bringing the total to 19. It will launch in the U.S. before the end of the year. Dating brings with it a new feature called Secret Crush that expands it beyond strangers and friends-of-friends. Choose up to 9 friends you like-like. If they’ve opted into Facebook Dating, they’ll get a notification that some friend has a crush on them. If they add you as a Secret Crush too, you’re both notified and can chat on Messenger.Facebook Dating product manager Charmaine Hung tells me that “I have 2,000 Facebook friends. I’m not best friends with all 2,000 people, and there’s a good chance that one of that could be a really good match with me. I trust them, I appreciate them and I know we’re compatible. The only thing missing is knowing if we’re both interested in being more than just friends without the fear of rejection if you were to do this in real life.”Read Josh Constine’s thought piece on what Facebook’s conference meant:Facebook pivots to what it wishes it wasFacebook announced Dating at F8 a year ago and launched it in Colombia in September. Users opt-in, and then browse Events and Groups they’re part of for potential matches. They send them a text-only message based on something in their profile, which goes to a special Dating inbox. And if that person reciprocates, they can chat and maybe meet up. Now it’s opening in the Philippines, Vietnam, Singapore, Malaysia, Laos, Brazil, Peru, Chile, Bolivia, Ecuador, Paraguay, Uruguay, Guyana and Suriname.One concern with Secret Crush is that users might spam the feature by constantly adding and removing people from their list until they discover a match. That’s why Facebook will only let you sub out one person per day after you reach your initial limit of 9.Currently there’s still no plan to monetize Dating, but that’s not the point. After years of scandals, Facebook needs to prove it deserves to be your social network. Mindlessly browsing the News Feed has proven to be exhausting and at times detrimental to health. But if the app can introduce you to your future spouse, or even just a summer fling, you might keep a place in your heart for Facebook too.Click below to check out all of TechCrunch’s Facebook conference coverage from today:Facebook pivots to what it wishes it was",https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/30/facebook-dating-secret-crush/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

Besides the departure of its CEO Ananth Narayanan, Jabong’s staff count was slashed by more than 40 per cent as more than 200 people were asked to leave. This created doubts among the Myntra employees that the stage was being set for the possible merger with Flipkart fashion unit.McKenna, who heads the $118-billion international business for Walmart and was responsible for piecing together Flipkart deal last year, said that India is viewed as a high growth market where Walmart intends to pour in more funds in future. Some of Myntra’s in-house brands could also go global, she said.She said that e-tailer was committed to problem-solving through technology, design and innovation.Along with Myntra-Jabong, Flipkart is estimated to control 60-70% of online fashion sales in India. Its dominance in fashion was a major attraction for Walmart, which agreed to pay $16 billion to buy a 77% stake in Flipkart in May last year.While the e-commerce players are coming to terms with new FDI norms for the industry, the current year is expected to see a shake-up with the imminent entry of Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries into online retail.

19684,Video: Drone delivers kidney for transplant 5 km away in 10 minutes,"A drone delivered a kidney to surgeons at University of Maryland Medical Center, ferrying it from a hospital around five kilometres away in nine minutes and 52 seconds. It was the first time a drone was used to drop off an organ for a transplant. The kidney was successfully transplanted into a patient, who was on dialysis for eight years.",Daily Mail,"A kidney delivered by drone has been transplanted into a patient in need for the first time ever. University of Maryland (UMD) doctors and engineers worked together to create a custom drone that could carry an organ with perfect stability, while monitoring it and communicating with the teams on the ground. Every second counts during the transplantation process.  Delivery delays of a single hour, which are common, can make the difference between a viable and non-viable organ - and whether its intended recipient lives or dies. By cutting out the complications of freight and passenger planes and airports, the University of Maryland team wondered if an unmanned drone could money and precious time in the organ transplantation process. In a world first, they flew a 44-year-old's new kidney over two miles in an unmanned drone from the Living Legacy Foundation organ distribution center to the University of Maryland Medical Center(both in Baltimore) on April 19. A specially designed drone (pictured) flew a donated kidney over two miles in 10 minutes to be transplanted at University of MarylandFor an organ transplant to be successful, so much has to be right.  Donor and recipient have to have the same blood type, be around the same size and timing has to be perfect. This leaves little room for error or delay. Yet, even after all of these factors are aligned, organs don't always make it to their destinations and their recipients.  In fact, about 1.5 percent of organs don't get to their destinations. It's a small percentage, but it means that some 1,710 out of 114,000 people on the transplant list lose their organs to these issues. Last year, 2,700 kidneys were simply thrown away because they expired before they could be transplanted.  In one frustrating incidence, a kidney slated for a a three to four hour trip from Atlanta to Baltimore was caught in transit and didn't reach its destination for 29 hours, Matthew Scassero, director of UMD's unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) programs told Dailymail.com. So he and project lead Dr Joseph Scalea wanted to try to tackle these delays using drones. The system uses the standard organ transportation box, but outfitted with a system they developed using the 'guts of a cell phone' to remotely track not just the location but the 'medical condition' of a flying organ, Scassero said.  Scassero's team also designed a totally new drone to comply with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) guidelines while incorporating multiple redundancies - back op rotors and a parachute - to come as close as possible to ensuring a traveling organ would remain viable no matter what happened. The team loaded a kidney up and flew it 2.8 miles in just under 10 minutes, from the Living Legacy Foundation organ distribution center to UMD Medical Center. 'We found it had less vibration and temperature variation than if we had put the kidney in other craft,' like ambulances or charter planes, Scassero said. 'It was maintained no matter what.' The organ drone made a smooth landing, and was successfully transplanted into a 44-year-old recipient who had spent the last eight years on dialysis.This maiden voyage was just a proof of concept and, but Scassero says that within two to three years it could be ready for common use for short distances. 'What we envision is a completely unmanned distribution system, where all the routes are programmed in and from the distribution center, you hit go and from that point until the drone arrives, it's all automated,' Scassero said.     ",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-6972927/World-scientists-successfully-fly-kidney-DRONE-patient-Maryland.html?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

The new price range between $23 and $25 a share, up from $19 and $21, values the plant burger making startup at nearly $1.5 billion.",Reuters," (This April 30 story corrects first paragraph to say company will debut on Thursday, not Wednesday.) (Reuters) - Plant-based meat maker Beyond Meat Inc on Tuesday increased the expected price range and size of its initial public offering, ahead of an expected market debut on Thursday, indicating strong investor demand. The company said it expects to offer 9.63 million shares, up from 8.75 million shares and the IPO to be priced between $23 and $25 per share, up from $19 and $21 per share, its latest filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission showed.  The higher end of the indicative price range gives the company a market value of $1.49 billion, up from $1.21 billion earlier. Plant-based meat substitutes have been gaining popularity as more attention is focused on the environmental hazards of industrial ranching. The Los Angeles-based company in early January announced it was rolling out its plant-based burger at fast-food chain Carl’s Jr. Investors in Beyond Meat include actor Leonardo DiCaprio and Microsoft Corp founder Bill Gates. Tyson Foods Inc, the no. 1 U.S. meat processor, owned a 6.5 percent stake in Beyond Meat, but last week said it sold its investment in the vegan burger maker, as it looks to develop its own line of alternative protein products. Beyond Meat’s net loss narrowed marginally to $29.89 million in the year ended Dec. 31, from $30.38 million a year earlier. Net revenue more than doubled to $87.93 million in the same period.

I hope he'll have a quiet life with his wife.""Outside Tokyo, locals wearing kimonos performed a traditional dance in Gifu, central Japan, to mark the imperial transition -- planning to dance all night.Crowds gathered outside the Imperial Palace, although the drizzle threatened to dampen some of the enthusiasmSeveral couples held their wedding ceremonies at midnight at hotels to join the national celebration.And crowds braved torrential rain to see in the new era at Tokyo's famous Shibuya crossing.""The emperor was a good person. He played an important role during the March 11 quake. He was the symbol of Japan. I hope the new emperor will carry on the kindness the old emperor had,"" said Rika Yamamoto, a 24-year-old company employee sheltering under an umbrella on the crossing.However, not everything was beautiful and harmonious as minor scuffles broke out near Shinjuku, the world's busiest station, with right-wingers briefly clashing with anti-monarchy protesters.- 'Lost decade' -Naruhito will formally ""inherit"" the imperial symbols of an ancient sword and jewel at a formal ceremony at 10:30 am on Wednesday. The third piece of the imperial regalia -- a mirror -- never leaves the palace.As Naruhito ascends the throne, he will find a very different Japan than his father took over in 1989.At the end of the 1980s, Japan ruled the world economically, its technology was the envy of every industrialised nation and its stock market at highs unlikely to be matched again.Emperor Akihito and his wife Michiko won plaudits for a popular touch, notably comforting people affected by the 2011 earthquake, tsunami and nuclear meltdown that devastated whole swathes of east Japan and killed thousandsBut after a ""lost decade"" when the bubble burst, Japan is still locked in a battle against deflation and sluggish growth while its population ages rapidly and many rural areas suffer from depopulation to the major cities.Naruhito will also face the challenge of continuing his father's legacy while maintaining Japanese traditions that stretch back centuries.Akihito changed the role of emperor that remains sensitive in Japan after the country's militaristic past in the name of his father Hirohito.He was loved for his popular touch and he melted hearts when he bowed humbly before victims of the 2011 earthquake and tsunami, gently comforting them and listening to their tales of suffering.Waqas Adenwala, an analyst at the Economic Intelligence Unit, said: ""Given the standards set by his father, Emperor Naruhito will be expected to maintain a similar approach and extend his outreach to the society through public appearances.""The Japanese monarchy stretches back for centuriesBut the Oxford-educated Naruhito has also criticised the sometimes stifling constraints on the imperial family, especially as his wife Masako -- a former diplomat -- has struggled to adapt to life in the palace and has seen her health suffer.""Masako may have difficulties fulfilling her duties but it will be good if she can participate in imperial tasks, so far as her health allows,"" Kumio Sudo, a 67-year-old pensioner, told AFP.The abdication has resulted in a 10-day holiday in Japan, although polls show many famously hard-working Japanese were opposed to such a long break.They have nonetheless seized on the rare opportunity to travel, with bullet trains and airports overflowing and Tokyo's usually packed commuter trains eerily empty at rush hour.Meanwhile, entrepreneurs have sold everything from ""Reiwa"" bottles of sake to $10 cans of air from the ""Heisei"" era of Akihito's reign.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-6974773/End-era-Japans-emperor-kicks-abdication-rites.html?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
19715,2 people contract HIV allegedly after 'vampire facial' at spa in US,"Two people have been diagnosed with HIV allegedly after getting 'vampire facials' in a spa in US' New Mexico. The spa was shut down last year after inspection revealed the staff was using its needles improperly. Following the closure, the state's health facility contacted over 100 clients of the spa to get tested, of which two were diagnosed.",Daily Mail,"After discovering that two people contracted HIV from 'vampire facials' at an Albuquerque spa, the New Mexico Department of Health is urging all clients who got injection services at the now-shuttered facility to get tested. Last year, an inspection of VIP Spa revealed the staff was using its needles improperly, and the shop was closed down. Since its September 2018 closure, over 100 clients have been tested and two have been diagnosed with HIV, suggesting they may have been infected at the spa. It is unclear when VIP Spa opened, but KOB 4 reported that the spa's license expired in 2013. Health officials are offering free HIV testing at two locations for anyone who visited the unsanitary spa. Two former clients of the now-shuttered VIP Spa in Albuquerque, New Mexico have tested positive for the same strain of HIV after having vampire facials there. Health officials are urging all clients that had needle services to get tested Although HIV is often sexually transmitted, it can also be contracted through needle sharing and is thus common among injection drug users. But a pair of unlucky spa visitors in Albuquerque didn't even realize the needles poked into their faces by technicians at VIP Spa were unclean. Last year, New Mexico Department of Health (NMDOH) officials discovered during an inspection that VIP's practices had the potential to expose clients to 'bloodborne illnesses.' At the time, it announced simply that one client had developed some kind of infection, which they might have contracted from a vampire facial at the spa. Health officials advised anyone who had visited - especially those who had had an 'injection related service, including a vampire facial' - to get tested, specifically, for hepatitis B and C and HIV. It was an alarming message to receive about a seemingly inocuous activity, but it cast an even more terrifying light over the already-spooky facial method. Minimally invasive cosmetic procedures are in vogue and on the rise in the US (thanks in part to Kim Kardashian West, who popularized the vampire facial, among other augmentations). In 2017, 15.7 million such minor procedures were done in the US, and the top two - Botox injections and soft tissue fillers - involve needles. Vampire facials gained popularity after Kim Kardashian West got one in 2017 Vampire facials are done by extracting blood from a person's body, supercharging the growth factor and cell renewal portion of it in a centrifuge, the injecting the blood back into the face where it should encourage cell turnover. They're by no means the most common or, broadly speaking, the most dangerous cosmetic procedure, but that doesn't mean there aren't risks. The procedure itself is fairly safe, but unsanitary practices are not.  Any time the skin is being broken, the risk of infection goes up, and when needles get involved, the risk is increased further, if the clinician's practices are not sterile.Now, seven months after the first VIP Spa client tested positive for HIV, another out of 100 tested in total has been diagnosed with the infection, too. Both clients contracted the same strain, pointing even more sharply at VIP as the probable source. Even if needles are cleaned, HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C can all be transmitted through needle sharing because infected blood cells far too small to see can remain, and end up injected directly into the blood stream of another person. After the discovery of the second infected client of VIP, the NMDOH is reiterating its warning that all of the spa's clients need to be tested before they unwittingly spread the virus Medical advancements mean HIV viral loads  can now be kept at an untransmissible level, this required medication. And if an infection is left undetected and treating, the disease can not only spread but weaken the immune system, leaving positive people vulnerable to opportunistic infections that may overwhelm their suppressed defenses.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-6973771/Vampire-facials-gave-HIV-two-New-Mexico-spa-clients-officials-warn.html?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

19723,Google parent Alphabet records slowest revenue growth in 3 years,"Google parent Alphabet has recorded its slowest revenue growth in three years over increased competition in advertising, changes in YouTube algorithms, among other factors, Reuters stated. Alphabet recorded $36.3 billion in revenue in the first quarter of 2019 up 17% from $31.1 billion in the same quarter last year. Alphabet revenue fell short of analysts' expectation of about $37 billion.",Reuters,"(Reuters) - Alphabet Inc’s Google on Monday saw its slowest revenue growth in three years from increased competition in advertising, stumbles in its smartphone business and disruptive changes at YouTube that left the leading internet ad company lagging rivals. Shares of Alphabet dropped 7.5 percent after hours, setting them up for the biggest one-day drop since falling 8 percent in October 2012. They had closed Monday at a record-high of $1,296.20. Alphabet Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat attributed slower revenue growth to currency fluctuations, competition and unspecified product changes.  The company is facing continued pressure from advertisers to tighten controls on its fast-growing YouTube video service so that they not appear to be sponsoring adult or offensive content.  Google also is struggling to find the right mix of ad formats to use on mobile devices, voice assistant-enabled home speakers and in emerging markets. Eight of the 11 analysts who questioned executives on a call on Monday asked about the revenue issues, an unusual level of shared interest. But the executives offered limited new details, prompting Barclays’ analyst Ross Sandler near the end to preface a question by saying he was just beating a dead horse.  Reflecting on the sales growth slowdown, Porat said unspecified changes at YouTube had boosted first-quarter revenue a year ago, with nothing delivering a comparable bump this year. About 85 percent of Alphabet’s revenue comes from Google’s ad business, which sells links, banners and commercials across its own websites and apps and those of partners.  Chief Executive Sundar Pichai said revenue slowdowns should be expected as the company focuses on the long term.  “You are going to have quarter-to-quarter variations once in a while, but we remain confident about the opportunities we see,” he said on a conference call. Major competitors for ad spending such as Facebook Inc, Snap Inc, Amazon.com Inc and Twitter Inc all reported last week quarterly revenue above or in line with analysts’ expectations. Alphabet said its quarterly revenue rose 17 percent from a year ago to $36.3 billion, about $1 billion short of Wall Street’s average estimate, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.   The company said it would have met expectations, adjusting for currency fluctuations.  The growth was the slowest since 17 percent in the first quarter of 2016 and compared with 26 percent for the same quarter in 2018. Facebook, the No. 2 internet ad company, posted 26 percent growth to $15.1 billion in quarterly results last week.    “Google ad revenue growth has been slowing amid downward pressure on ad prices, especially for revenues coming from international markets,” Monica Peart, senior forecasting director for ad research firm eMarketer said in a statement.      Alphabet’s quarterly costs rose about the same as revenue, up 16.5 percent from last year to $29.7 billion. Expenses have surged faster than revenue for much of the past two years as it adds data centers, offices and YouTube content licenses, concerning some investors amid increased scrutiny on the company’s privacy practices and the advertising restrictions at YouTube.   More advertising controls are coming to YouTube in the coming weeks that could affect sales, Pichai said. In the first quarter, sales of Google’s Pixel phones also struggled from intense competition in the premium smartphone market, Porat said. The company is expected to introduce lower-priced Pixel devices next month. Alphabet has yet to tout significant revenue from its spending on ventures such as self-driving cars and its AI helper Google Assistant. Newer units that are producing noticeable revenue have lagged in market share, including Google’s consolidated hardware unit and Google Cloud, which sells computing and data storage services to businesses. And Google’s costs could jump further if governments globally follow through on threats to rein in the ability of apps to track users for advertising purposes. Other regulators have discussed forcing companies to step up monitoring of user content. Cost will rise in the current quarter as Google resumes some marketing efforts, Porat said.  Shares of Alphabet have gained 23 percent this year as positive macroeconomic signals had given investors reason to bet on it. But it is the least growth among the so-called FAANG group, with Facebook at 48 percent, Netflix at 39 percent, Apple at 30 percent and Amazon at 29 percent.  Alphabet’s expenses included a $1.7 billion fine from the European Commission for having placed anticompetitive advertising restrictions on websites using its searches. Google’s 3 billion users help make it the world’s largest seller of internet ads, capturing nearly a third of all revenue, according to research firm eMarketer. Facebook is at about 20 percent. Including the European fine, net income was $6.7 billion, or $9.50 per share, compared with analysts’ average estimate of $7.3 billion, or $10.48 per share. Earnings excluding the fine were $8.3 billion, or $11.90 per share, beating analysts’ estimates $10.61 per share for adjusted earnings. Operating margin excluding the fine was 23 percent, up from 22 percent in the year-ago period.

19724,There won't be 100 unicorns in India anytime soon: CRED CEO,"Credit card bill payment startup CRED's Founder and CEO Kunal Shah has said he doesn't believe there will be 100 unicorns (billion-dollar startups) in India anytime soon because ""founders don't plan better"". ""But I ask, why canÂ’t you plan better?Â” Shah, who had co-founded FreeCharge, added. He cited the example of how CRED was launched after several months of research.",YourStory,"India’s 'unicorn' club may be gaining more members every month, but Kunal Shah doesn’t believe that the number is going to leapfrog any time soon. The Founder and CEO of Cred, who also founded and sold payments app Freecharge, is categorical that there won’t be 100 unicorns in India anytime soon because “founders don't plan better”.Speaking recently at India Internet Day (iDay), which was centred on ‘unboxing’ opportunities and trends to enable 100 unicorns in India by 2025, he said that a lot of times people confuse the whole concept of ‘fail fast’.“But I ask, why can’t you plan better?” he said. Kunal then cited the example of how Cred was launched after one year of market research.Kunal's comments came as a part of a chat with angel investor Gautam Gandhi at the event hosted by TiE Delhi-NCR, as part of a keynote address titled, ‘Entrepreneurial Milestones: unboxing Pivots & Pirouettes to Exits’.Also read: India will have more than 100 unicorns in the next 5 years: Binny Bansal at TiEcon Mumbai Kunal said the fact that founders do not ask each other a lot of questions may also be a reason. “Like when I ran Freecharge, I had an understanding of most of India's internet consumption behaviour. But, in my five years of running Freecharge, not a single founder reached out to me to ask about how Indians are using the internet. Now, I have been running Cred for almost six months, and not a single founder has reached out to me, asking what people are spending money on?” he said.He asserted that global players who have much sharper insights about India will keep beating Indian startups unless they manage to deal with them through regulatory games, “which is not the desired way of winning”. “This is going to hurt us all,” Kunal added, expounding further on why he believes India won’t produce 100 unicorns in the near future.Also read: Lyft and Uber IPOs make us wonder: when will Indian unicorns go public?Speaking about exiting Freecharge after five years of running it, Kunal said while it was the right decision at that time, Kunal debunked the myth that an exit translates into an easy time for a founder. Rather, Kunal said it means “almost crushing depression for months”. When asked what motivated him to start up again, Kunal said it was his “addiction to sangharsh (battle)”.Kunal also shared some lessons from his Freecharge journey, saying that the most important lessons for every entrepreneur are execution, self-confidence, and betting on younger teams. “A lot of times we try bringing in a lot of people with top experience. But they come with a lot of baggage. If you are an original product guy, it’s better you have a younger team with a lot more energy because it's easy to navigate that process,” he said. The serial entrepreneur ended by speaking about the most important lesson: “things don't work out as you like or plan, and it’s imperative for everyone to be good at learning human behaviour”. “Please understand that your co-founders, investors, and employees, all are humans,” Kunal said.Also read: Kunal Shah finally talks about the story behind his new venture, CRED",https://yourstory.com/2019/04/startup-unicorns-india-kunal-shah-cred-freecharge?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

Both countries recorded 29 deals, a decrease for China which recorded 76 deals three quarters ago. The report suggested tightened regulation around online lending in China may have caused the drop.",TechCrunch,"China’s massive fintech industry took a beating in recent months as the government continued to wind down online lending nationwide, rattling investor confidence.Funding for fintech startups shrank 87.6 percent year-over-year to $192.1 million during the first quarter of 2019, a new report from data provider CB Insights shows. India, which recorded $285.6 million raised for fintech startups in the period, overtook China to be Asia’s top fundraising hub for financial technology. Both countries clocked in 29 fintech deals, suggesting a cooling investor sentiment in China which saw its height of 76 deals just three quarters ago.Chart: CB InsightsChart: CB InsightsThe plunge in China has followed on the heels of tightened regulation around online lending, suggests CB Insights . Over the past few years, China has rolled out a flurry of measures to rein in financial risks arising from its fledgling online lending industry. Peer-to-peer lending, which matches an individual looking for a loan with someone looking to invest, has been the top target in a wave of government crackdowns.This kind of service offers credit to unbanked individuals who cannot otherwise get loans in a country without a mature unified credit system. But a lack of oversight led to rampant frauds across the board. Thousands of peer-to-peer lending sites shut down due to increased regulation, which is estimated to leave as few as 300 players on the market by the end of 2019, Shanghai-based research firm Yingcai forecasted.Like China, India’s enthusiasm for finance technology is in part a result of the country’s lack of financial infrastructure. Lending startups are gathering steam as they, like their Chinese counterparts, tailor services to the country’s large unbanked and underbanked consumers and enterprises. Moves from tech leaders are also set to send ripples through the rest of the industry. Amazon finally followed its rivals Paytm, Google Pay and PhonePe to start offering peer-to-peer payments in the country. Walmart is closely watching how Flipkart, which it bought out last year, applies data to payments solution.Chart: CB InsightsChart: CB InsightsDespite the setback in online lending, a new form of consumer-facing financing vehicle — so-called mutual aid platforms that let patients crowdfund for serious diseases — is enjoying an early boom in China, CB Insights noted in its report. As with peer-to-peer lending, internet-powered mutual aid is trying to fill gaps in a traditional industry. Though most Chinese people are part of a national public insurance scheme, surgical bills can easily bring down an average family.The top two performers in the sector are unsurprisingly from the top two opposing camps in China’s tech world. Shuidihuzhu, which translates as “water drop mutual help” in Chinese, counts Tencent as a major investor. Users contribute as little as half a cent to a pool of funds that pays out when a patient needs financial aid. The three-year-old platform, which leverages Tencent’s billion-user WeChat messenger to sign up members, claims it has attracted 78.8 million users and paid out nearly 440 million yuan $65.34 million to more than 3,100 families so far.Shuidihuzhu’s rival, which is called Xiang Hu Bao and means “mutual protection”, is run by Alibaba’s affiliate e-wallet Alipay. Launched only last September, the service said it had acquired over 50 million users by April and had set itself up for an ambitious goal: to reach low-income groups who can’t afford the premiums and advance payments attached to traditional health insurance and to acquire 300 million users in the next two years. That means almost a third of Alipay users, most of whom live in Chia. By the end of 2018, the digital wallet had over 1 billion annual users worldwide.",https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/30/india-unseats-china-as-asias-top-fintech-funding-source/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

19780,Boeing CEO Muilenburg says he will not step down,"Boeing Chairman and CEO Dennis Muilenburg has clarified he won't be resigning from the company, as shareholders called for splitting his two roles. ""My clear intent is to continue to lead on the front of safety, quality and integrity,"" he stated. Muilenburg further promised to win back public's trust in the wake of two fatal crashes involving the 737 MAX.",Reuters,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Boeing Co CEO and Chairman Dennis Muilenburg emerged with his job intact at an annual meeting on Monday and promised to win back the public’s trust after facing tough questions in the wake of two fatal crashes of the 737 MAX plane. Battling the biggest crisis of his nearly four years as chief executive officer, Muilenburg survived a shareholder motion to split his chairman and CEO roles. He later told reporters he would continue to lead the company through a crisis that has triggered the grounding of Boeing’s fastest-selling plane, lawsuits, investigations and lingering concerns over the 737 MAX’s safety. “I am very focused on safety going forward,” he said after the meeting when reporters asked if he had considered resigning. “I am strongly vested in that. My clear intent is to continue to lead on the front of safety, quality and integrity.”      However, Boeing will need to win back the trust of customers, passengers and regulators following the crashes.      “We know we do have work to do to earn and re-earn that trust and we will,” Muilenburg said before ending the 16-minute news conference and ignoring shouted questions from reporters as he walked away. The family of one American victim, 24-year-old Samya Stumo, staged a silent protest outside the meeting site in Chicago, while the families of other victims among the 157 killed in the crash of an Ethiopian Airlines 737 MAX on March 10 held a tearful press conference at a Chicago law firm.  That plane plunged to the ground shortly after takeoff from Addis Ababa, five months after a similar Lion Air nosedive in Indonesia that killed all 189 passengers and crew. The families spoke after filing a wrongful death lawsuit against Boeing and Rosemount Aerospace Inc, which designed the sensors used in the 737 MAX, in Chicago federal court, one of dozens of lawsuits Boeing is facing over both crashes. Daniel Johnson, an engineer and an intermittent Boeing shareholder since 1984, said the company “really stubbed their toe” by allowing the plane’s anti-stall system - called Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System or MCAS - to rely on only one sensor. “The question is: Will they need to rebrand? We don’t know how much the general public actually knows what a 737 MAX is,” Johnson said outside the meeting. About 150 shareholders gathered in the auditorium of the Chicago Field Museum for the meeting, but only a handful questioned Muilenburg over the MAX.  One shareholder asked Muilenburg what Boeing was doing on safety assessments following the crashes. The CEO said the company’s commitment to safety has not wavered. “Safety is at the core of what we do. Every day, we try to get better,” Muilenburg said at the meeting, which took place exactly six months after the Lion Air crash. Shares of the company, worth $214 billion, have lost nearly 10 percent of their value since the March 10 crash.   Boeing is under pressure to deliver a software fix to prevent erroneous data from triggering the MCAS system and a new pilot training package that will convince global regulators, and the flying public, that the aircraft is safe.  Boeing has acknowledged that the accidental firing of the software based on bad sensor data was a common link in the chain of events leading to the two accidents. “We know we can break this link in the chain. It’s our responsibility to eliminate this risk,” Muilenburg told shareholders. When asked by reporters if the MCAS system was flawed, he said only that Boeing was making improvements to it. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration could clear Boeing’s 737 MAX jet to fly in late May or the first part of June, two people familiar with the matter said on Friday, though Boeing has yet to submit the updated software and training for review.  Some pilots have warned that draft training proposals do not go far enough to address their concerns. Boeing repeated on Monday it was making progress to certify its grounded jets with the software update.     Meanwhile, deliveries of the 737 MAX, which airlines around the world had been relying on to service a growing air travel industry for years to come, are on hold.  Muilenburg said Boeing has been talking to customers and is sensitive to the impact of the crisis on their operations. He said the focus is on getting the MAX flying again. Last week Boeing abandoned its 2019 financial outlook, halted share buybacks and said lowered production due to the 737 MAX grounding had cost it at least $1 billion so far. Shareholders have filed a lawsuit accusing the company of defrauding them by concealing safety deficiencies in the plane. The model is also the target of investigations by U.S. transportation authorities and the Department of Justice. The FAA is also investigating at least four calls from whistleblowers on concerns including the angle of attack sensor and MCAS, a government official said on Monday. Boeing declined to comment. Manant Vaidya of Canada, who lost six family members in the Ethiopian crash, said he had repeatedly heard Muilenburg defending the design and certification of the 737 MAX. “At the end of the day, if everything was followed how could the crash have occurred?” Vaidya asked at the news conference at Clifford Law Offices.

The tokens earned could be used to pay for tolls, parking and charging for electric cars.",Reuters,"(Reuters) - Jaguar Land Rover, Britain’s largest auto manufacturer, said on Monday it is testing software that will allow drivers of its cars to earn the IOTA cryptocurrency as a reward for sharing data. The company is developing what it calls “smart wallet” technology to be installed in its automobiles. This would reward Jaguar car drivers with IOTA coins for actions such as enabling their vehicles to automatically report useful data, such as traffic congestion or potholes to navigation providers or local authorities. Drivers could also earn rewards if the car participates in a ride-sharing program, Jaguar said. The tokens earned could be used to pay for tolls, parking and charging for electric cars. The overall goal was to “achieve zero emissions, zero accidents, and zero congestion,” the company said. Global car companies are exploring blockchain applications, figuring out different ways in which they can leverage the technology to suit their different needs. Blockchain, the system powering cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, is a shared database that is maintained by a network of computers connected to the internet. The British car company is testing the technology at the new Jaguar Land Rover software engineering base in Shannon, Ireland, where engineers have already equipped several vehicles, including the Jaguar F-PACE and Range Rover Velar, with “smart wallet” features, the company said. It does not yet have a timetable for when it will be commercially available, said Jaguar, a subsidiary of Tata Motors. The IOTA token is based on a distributed ledger technology that enables people and machines to transfer money and data without any transaction fees. IOTA trades on digital asset exchanges and was last at 27 U.S. cents per token. “The smart wallet technology ... can be easily adapted into all new vehicles,” Dominik Schiener, IOTA co-founder and co-chairman of its board, told Reuters on Friday. “IOTA wants to enable interoperability with all these different players. So there is no Jaguar coin, no BMW coin, but one universal token for this machine economy,” he added.

19805,Indonesia to relocate its capital from Jakarta,"Indonesian President Joko Widodo is planning to move the capital away from Jakarta to outside of Java Island. The government is considering Indonesia's eastern side as the destination for the new capital, in a move that could take up to 10 years. Jakarta is one of the world's most overpopulated city and has one of the worst traffic congestion.",Reuters,"JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia’s president has decided to move the capital of the world’s fourth most populous country away from the crowded main island of Java, but has yet to finalize a new location, the planning minister said on Monday. President Joko Widodo’s decision comes less than two weeks after private pollsters said he had won an April 17 presidential election, although official results are not due until May 22. His challenger, Prabowo Subianto, has also claimed victory. “The president chose to relocate the capital city to outside of Java, an important decision,” Minister Bambang Brodjonegoro told a news conference after a cabinet meeting. Brodjonegoro said the administration had yet to pick a new location, but was looking at the eastern side of the sprawling archipelago. At the opening of his cabinet meeting, Widodo stressed the need for new thinking about the future. “We want to think in a visionary way for the progress of this country and moving the capital requires thorough and detailed preparation,” he said. The current capital, Jakarta, is home to more than 10 million people, but around three times that many people live in the surrounding towns adding to the area’s severe congestion. Brodjonegoro put the annual economic loss due to traffic congestion in Jakarta at 100 trillion rupiah ($7.04 billion). The low-lying capital is also prone to flooding and is sinking due to over-extraction of ground water. In making his decision, Widodo had also taken into account the fact that nearly 60 percent of Indonesia’s 260 million people live in Java and economic activities were concentrated there, Brodjonegoro said.  During the recent election campaign, Widodo promised to spread economic development more evenly outside Java. The planning minister did not estimate the cost of moving the capital but said the president had ordered the finance ministry to come up with a financing scheme that allowed participation of private investors. He said moving the capital could take up to 10 years, citing examples such as Brazil and Kazakhstan. One of the contenders for the new capital city is Palangkaraya in Central Kalimantan province on the island of Borneo, state news agency Antara reported this year. Authorities there had prepared 300,000 hectares of land in case it is chosen as a new government hub, Antara said.

19815,I felt very alone in our marriage after our 1st child: Melinda Gates,"World's second richest person Bill Gates' wife Melinda Gates in her memoir revealed that she felt ""very alone"" in her marriage after the couple's first child, Jennifer, was born in 1996. ""Bill was CEO of Microsoft. He was beyond busy; everyone wanted him,"" said Melinda. ""I thought...maybe he wanted to have kids in theory, but not in reality,"" she added.",Daily Mail,"In 1995, after Bill and I had been married nearly two years and were about to leave on a trip to China, I discovered I was pregnant.This China trip was a huge deal for us. Bill rarely took time off from Microsoft, and we were going with other couples as well.I didn’t want to mess up the trip, so I considered not telling Bill I was pregnant until we came back. For a day and a half, I thought, I’ll just save the news. Then I realised: ‘No, I’ve got to tell him because what if something goes wrong? And, more basically, I’ve got to tell him because it’s his baby, too.’When I sat Bill down for the baby talk one morning before work, he had two reactions. He was thrilled about the baby, and then he said: ‘You considered not telling me? Are you kidding?’It hadn’t taken me long to come up with my first bad parenting idea.Melinda Gates who has been married to Microsoft co-founder Bill (pictured together) for over 20 years reveals how their relationship has changed with time in a fascinating new memoirOn the way home from China, I shocked Bill by saying: ‘I’m not going to keep working after I have this baby. I’m not going back.’He was stunned. ‘What do you mean, you’re not going back?’ And I said: ‘We’re lucky enough not to need my income. So this is about how we want to raise a family. You’re not going to downshift at work, and I don’t see how I can put in the hours I need to do a great job at work and raise a family at the same time.’I’m offering you a candid account of this exchange with Bill to make an important point: When I first confronted the challenges of being a working woman and a mother, I had some growing up to do. My personal model back then — and I don’t think it was a very conscious model — was that when couples had children, men worked and women stayed home.Frankly, I think it’s great if women want to stay at home. But it should be a choice — not something we do because we think we have no choice. I don’t regret my decision. I’d make it again. At the time, though, I just assumed that’s what women do.This threw Bill. Me being at Microsoft was a huge part of our life together. Bill co-founded the company in 1975. I joined Microsoft in 1987, the only woman in the first class of MBAs [Master of Business Administration graduates]. We met shortly afterward, at a company event.I was on a trip to New York for Microsoft, and my roommate (we doubled up back then to save money) told me to come to a dinner I hadn’t known about. I showed up late, and all the tables were filled except one, which still had two empty chairs side by side. I sat in one of them. A few minutes later, Bill arrived and sat in the other.We talked over dinner that evening and I sensed he was interested, but I didn’t hear from him for a while. Then, one Saturday, we ran into each other in the company parking lot.Melinda (pictured) first met Bill during a trip to New York while working for Microsoft, she was the only woman in the first class of MBAsHe struck up a conversation and asked me out for two weeks from Friday. I laughed and said: ‘That’s not spontaneous enough for me. Ask me out closer to the date,’ and gave him my number.Two hours later, he called me at home and invited me out for that evening. ‘Is this spontaneous enough for you?’ he asked.We found we had a lot in common. We both love puzzles, and we both love to compete. So we had puzzle contests and played math games.I think he got intrigued when I beat him at a math game and won the first time we played Clue, the board game where you figure out who did the murder in what room with what weapon. He urged me to read The Great Gatsby, his favourite novel, and I already had, twice.Maybe that’s when he knew he’d met his match. His romantic match, he would say. When we got engaged, someone asked Bill: ‘How does Melinda make you feel?’ and he answered: ‘Amazingly, she makes me feel like getting married.’But our conversations about the baby made it clear that the days of our both working at Microsoft were ending.I realise, looking back, that I faced a life-forming question in those early years: ‘Do you want to have a career or do you want to be a stay-at-home mom?’ And my answer was: ‘Yes! First career, then stay-at-home mom, then a mix of the two, then back to career.’I had an opportunity to have two careers and the family of my dreams because we were in the fortunate position of not needing my income. There was also another reason whose full significance wouldn’t become clear to me for years: I had the benefit of a small pill that allowed me to time and space my pregnancies.It’s no accident that I didn’t get pregnant until I had worked nearly a decade at Microsoft and Bill and I were ready to have children. It’s no accident Rory was born three years after Jenn, and our daughter, Phoebe, three years after Rory.Melinda (pictured with Bill and their children (l-r) Jennifer, Rory and Phoebe) recalls being moved by the mothers in Malawi who voiced concerns over family planning during an early trip for the Bill & Melinda Gates FoundationIt was my decision and Bill’s to do it this way. Of course, there was luck involved, too. I was fortunate to be able to get pregnant when I wanted to. But I also had the ability to not get pregnant when I didn’t want to.Bill and I formally set up the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in 2000. From the beginning, we were looking for problems that governments and markets weren’t addressing or solutions they weren’t trying. We wanted to discover the huge missed idea that would allow a small investment to spark massive improvement. Saving children’s lives was the goal that launched our global health work, and our first big investment came in vaccines.On one of my early trips for the foundation, I went to Malawi and was deeply moved to see so many mothers standing in the heat to get shots for their kids. I remember seeing a young mother and asking her: ‘Are you taking these beautiful children to get their shots?’ She answered: ‘What about my shot?’She wasn’t talking about a vaccination. She was talking about Depo-Provera, a long-acting birth control injection that could keep her from getting pregnant. She was just one of the many mothers I met during my early trips who switched the topic of our conversation from children’s vaccines to family planning.The mother-of-three argues contraceptives are the greatest life-saving, poverty-ending, women-empowering innovation of all (Pictured: The Gates estate in Washington, Seattle)I like to immerse myself in facts and statistics, and there is one correlation as near-perfect as any you’ll find in the world of data. Poverty goes hand-in-hand with powerless women. If you search for poverty, you will find women without power. If you explore prosperity, you will find women who have power and use it.It took me years to realise it, but when I did, it was an epiphany. Quite simply, contraceptives are the greatest life-saving, poverty-ending, women-empowering innovation ever created. And yet, I was a Catholic. I knew that becoming an advocate for family planning would expose me to criticism I wasn’t used to. Could I do it?I accepted an invitation from the UK government to co-sponsor a family planning summit in London, just before the 2012 Olympics. Immediately after, I was singled out for criticism in a front-page story in L’Osservatore Romano, the official Vatican newspaper. I had ‘gone astray,’ it said, and was ‘confused by misinformation.’The article charged that I was dismissing or distorting the value of natural family planning, and suggested I was being manipulated by corporations who stood to gain from selling contraceptives.Forbes Magazine later said the story showed that I ‘could take a punch’. I expected the punch — I also expected the online comments that referred to me as ‘former Catholic Melinda Gates’ or ‘so-called Catholic Melinda Gates’ — but it stung anyway.Melinda (pictured with Bill on their trip to China in 1995) says she has met women throughout her travels who do vast amounts of unpaid work such as cooking, cleaning and shoppingMy first reaction was: ‘I can’t believe they would say that!’ After a couple of days, though, I calmed down. I got why the Church said what it said. But I didn’t agree. Contraceptives save the lives of millions of women and children. That’s a medical fact.Injustice stalked the women I met on my travels to some of the poorest parts of the world. Not only did they have to work to earn money, but they did vastly more unpaid work.What do I mean by unpaid work? It’s work performed in the home, such as childcare or other caregiving, cooking, cleaning, shopping and errands done by a family member who is not being paid.On average, women spend more than twice as many hours as men on unpaid work. There is no country in the world where the gap is zero.This means that, on average, women do seven years more of unpaid work than men over their lifetimes. For women who spend all their hours doing unpaid work, the chores of the day kill the dreams of a lifetime.Thinking about the concept of unpaid work shapes the way I see what happens in our house. I want to be honest — I’ve had terrific, long-term help in raising our children and managing our household tasks, but I do know an imbalance in unpaid work when I see it in my own home. And I see it!Melinda (pictured with Bill Gates at a benefit in 2018) revealed fathers at her daughter's kindergarten began driving their children after they spotted Bill driving Jenn twice a weekIt’s a lot of work raising kids: taking them to school, to the doctor, to sports practise and drama lessons; supervising homework; sharing meals; keeping the family connected to friends at birthday parties, weddings, and graduations. And at different points, I have come to Bill, exhausted, and said: ‘Help!’When Jenn started kindergarten in the autumn of 2001, her school was 40 minutes away, and I knew I would be driving back and forth twice a day.When I complained to Bill about the time I’d be spending in the car, he said: ‘I can do some of that.’ And I said: ‘Seriously? You’ll do that?’ ‘Sure,’ he said. ‘It’ll give me time to talk to Jenn.’ So Bill started driving her twice a week.About three weeks in, on my days, I started noticing a lot of dads dropping kids off in the classroom. So I went up to one of the moms and said: ‘Hey, what’s up? There are a lot of dads here.’ She said: ‘When we saw Bill driving, we went home and said to our husbands: “Bill Gates is driving his child to school — you can, too.” ’A few years later, I realised that once again I was the last one in the kitchen after dinner, cleaning up for the five of us.It made me so indignant, I said: ‘Nobody leaves the kitchen until Mom leaves the kitchen.’ There’s nothing about being a mom that means I have to clean up while others wander off. Bill supported that — even if I did have to allow him his own niche as the guy who wants to wash the dishes because no one else gets it just right.Melinda (pictured with Bill at the Longines Global Champions Tour of Monaco) recalls feeling alone in her marriage when they first had Jenn Now, some of you might be thinking: ‘Oh, no — the privileged lady is tired of being the last one in the kitchen all by herself. But she doesn’t have to get up before the sun. Her childcare support is reliable.’I know. I know. I’m describing my own scene not because it’s a problem, but because it’s my vantage point on the problem.The gender imbalance in unpaid work is such a compelling subject for me in part because it’s a common burden that binds many women together.Ultimately, the hidden theme in every discussion of unpaid work is the equality of the relationship.When we first had Jenn, I felt very alone in our marriage. Bill was CEO of Microsoft at the time. He was beyond busy; everyone wanted him, and I was thinking, OK, maybe he wanted to have kids in theory, but not in reality.Early on, we had moved into this nice, family-sized house that I had picked out after we got engaged. He was fine with it. But a year-and-a-half later we were moving into this enormous house that Bill had begun building when he was a bachelor.I didn’t particularly want to move into that house. In fact, I didn’t feel like Bill and I were even on the same page of what we wanted, and we had little time to discuss it.Melinda (pictured with Bill and their children) says she has had to learn to step up and be an equal in the years since she and Bill have been together So in the middle of all that, I think I had a crisis of self. And it pushed me to figure out who I was and what I wanted to do.I was no longer the computer science business executive. I was a mom with a small child and a husband who was busy and travelling a lot, and we were moving into a gigantic house, and I was wondering what people would think of me, because that house was not me. That’s where I was when I began the long climb toward an equal partnership.We’ve come a long way in the 20 or so years since then. Bill has said often in interviews that he’s always had a partner in everything he’s ever done.That’s true, but he hasn’t always had an equal partner. He’s had to learn how to be an equal, and I’ve had to learn how to step up and be an equal.Adapted by Alison Roberts from The Moment Of Lift: How Empowering Women Changes The World, by Melinda Gates (£16.99, Bluebird). © Melinda Gates 2019.

Meanwhile, Walmart-owned Flipkart is partnering with Axis Bank or HDFC Bank later this quarter, the report added. Notably, Amazon had earlier launched co-branded credit card in partnership with ICICI Bank.",Entrackr,"Betting big on the next frontier of digital payment, ride-hailing app Ola and e-commerce marketplace Flipkart are set to launch credit cards in association with large banks.The move will not only give these companies insight into the spending pattern of their card users but at the same time help them enter an under-penetrated credit market, says a report appearing in ET.It is likely that Ola shall partner with State Bank of India (SBI) to come up with the credit card. The pilot for the same is expected to begin next week and the company reportedly plans to issue 1 million cards in the first year, leveraging its 150 million customer base.Entrackr in May last year had exclusively reported that Ola had put in place an internal team to look into the launch of the credit card. The enthusiasm with which the Millennials had taken to Ola Credit had pushed the company to think of having full-fledged credit cards for its customers.Typically in a partnership such as this, a bank handles risk analysis, card issuance, payment processing, credit line management and statement processing, while the merchant partner controls marketing, promotions and discounts. This will help the merchant company to structure the rewards in such way that it gets a peep into spending pattern of the customers.It may safely be presumed that the rewards offered would then be alluring enough for customers to go for the credit cards.Credit card collaboration shall help the internet companies map the transaction history of the customer, scan their offline spends, push increase spending on their stores by bundling it with rewards and over time have a better assessment of their paying capacity.Similarly, Flipkart too is evaluating data points to gauge a customer’s ability and intent to repay loans. A top executive of Flipkart is reported to have said the company is likely to launch this card in collaboration with Axis Bank or HDFC Bank later this quarter.The development, however, has not been confirmed by either of these companies.However, both Ola and Flipkart would be following the trend set by Amazon which had tied up with ICICI Bank to launch a co-branded credit card, which offers customers added rewards and benefits on the Amazon India ecosystem.Credit card partnerships are equally beneficial for banks as they get access to a large number of new customers at a relatively low cost. The merchants get know the offline spend of the customers. A combined database will unleash immense possibilities for both. Hence the ecosystem in the present environment is only expected to grow and flourish.",https://entrackr.com/2019/04/ola-flipkart-credit-cards/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

Earlier, the court asked the state to submit a report on implementation of the Mental Healthcare Act.",The News Minute,"In a landmark judgement, the Karnataka High Court has ruled that not all mental health ailments can constitute grounds for divorce. It further said that the mental health issue suffered by a spouse should be severe, incurable and recognised by Parliament for it to be considered as a valid ground for dissolution of marriage.“The ailments may come and go and some may stay with us. That per se cannot be a sufficient ground to seek decree for dissolution of marriage. If that were to be the ground for dissolution of marriage, the very institution of marriage would be unstable,” reads the order issued by a division bench headed by Justice Dixit.The issue was brought to light after a marital discord between a couple from Karnataka’s Dharwad taluk. A man by the name Hemanna was seeking to file for a divorce from his wife on the grounds that she suffered from a mental health problem. A doctor who cross-examined the woman deemed that her mental health condition would not come in the way of a normal marital life and that this could not be a ground for divorce.Hemanna claimed that his wife had been suffering from a mental health disorder and this had not been made known to him prior to getting married. The doctor who examined her, however, stated that her condition came to be after the birth of the couple’s second child and would not be a hindrance in their married life.Earlier, in the first week of April, the high court had asked the state government to submit a report on how the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act (2016) and the Mental Health Care (MHC) Act (2017) were being implemented. Petitioners wanted the state to ensure that the MHC rules were implemented and followed aptly in addition to ensuring that institutions for mental health care were set up in all districts.  ",https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/every-mental-health-ailment-cannot-constitute-grounds-divorce-k-taka-hc-100925?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
19827,RSS arm accuses PepsiCo of coercing farmers using legal action,"RSS economic wing Swadeshi Jagran Manch has accused PepsiCo of ""coercing"" four farmers sued by the US company for patent infringement. It said PepsiCo is using legal action to force them to either sell their output to the company or to stop growing FC5 potato variety. ""It's a clear case of a large MNC arm-twisting India's poor farmers,"" SJM added.",Reuters,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - An influential Hindu nationalist group with close ties to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has accused PepsiCo Inc of coercing four Indian farmers who have been sued by the U.S. company for allegedly infringing a patent. After suing four farmers for cultivating the FC5 potato variety, grown exclusively for PepsiCo’s popular Lay’s potato chips, the snack food and drinks maker on Friday said it wants to “amicably settle” the issue.  The Purchase, New York-based company said the four farmers had to either sell their potatoes to PepsiCo or stop cultivating the FC5 potato variety. In return, PepsiCo said it would withdraw the suit filed against the farmers. Ashwani Mahajan, who heads the Swadeshi Jagran Manch, said PepsiCo was “coercing” the farmers by using legal action to force them to either sell their output to the company or to stop growing the FC5 potato variety at all. SJM is the economic wing of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the ideological parent of Modi’s BJP.  The dispute comes at a particularly sensitive time in India, which is about half-way through a 39-day staggered general election, in which its rural population still has a dominant voice. Modi and the BJP are seeking a second term and most political strategists think they will likely get it. “Other than coercing these farmers, PepsiCo is also intimidating and exploiting them. It is a clear case of a large MNC (multi national corporation) arm-twisting India’s poor farmers,” Mahajan told Reuters. The federal government should step in to ensure that the farmers do not get harassed by PepsiCo, he said.     In response, a PepsiCo India spokesman said in a statement that it “has already proposed to amicably settle with people who were unlawfully using seeds of its registered variety.”  Adding: “The company was compelled to take the judicial recourse as a last resort to safeguard the larger interest of thousands of farmers that are engaged with its collaborative potato farming program.” The FC5 variety has a lower moisture content required to make snacks such as potato chips. PepsiCo maintains that it developed the FC5 variety, which has a lower moisture content required to make snacks such as potato chips, and registered the trait in 2016. In April, the company filed the lawsuit in a court in Ahmedabad, the business hub of Gujarat, requesting the court to retrain the four farmers from growing the FC5 variety. The court has asked the farmers not to use the variety until the next hearing scheduled for June 12. The court also appointed an officer to examine the issue. Other than filing the lawsuit, the company has also sought more than 10 million rupees ($142,840) each from the four farmers for alleged patent infringement. PepsiCo shouldn’t have gone to the court seeking heavy damages from farmers and a large corporation cannot be allowed to take on a handful of farmers, Mahajan said.     PepsiCo, which set up its first potato chips plant in India in 1989, supplies the FC5 potato variety to a group of farmers who in turn sell their produce to the company at a fixed price. The state government of Gujarat has assured the farmers that it will help them, Nitin Patel, deputy chief minister said last week. The opposition Congress party has also criticised PepsiCo for suing the farmers. “Pepsi’s decision to take Gujarat’s potato grower farmers to court is ill-advised and brazenly wrong,” senior Congress party leader Ahmed Patel, who comes from Gujarat, said in a Tweet.   The All India Kisan Sabha, or All India Farmers’ Forum, has asked the Indian government to protect the farmers and also called for a boycott of Lay’s chips and PepsiCo’s other products. So far the Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers’ Welfare has not commented on the issue. PepsiCo is the second large U.S. company to face major patent infringement issues in India. Stung by a long-standing intellectual property dispute, seed maker Monsanto, now owned by German drugmaker Bayer AG, withdrew from some businesses in India over a cotton-seed dispute with farmers.

Some lawmakers have opposed the bill saying fixing the age of 18 years is against the Sharia law. The bill now awaits a discussion in the lower house- the National Assembly.",The New Indian Express,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistani Senate has passed a bill to fix 18 years as the age of puberty for girls to end the practice of child marriages in the Muslim-majority country, triggering objections from some members who said the move was against Islam.The Child Marriage Restraint Act 1929 was presented by Senator Sherry Rehman of Pakistan Peoples Party, which will help to end the practice of child marriage in the country. The bill was passed on Monday after heated opposition by some lawmakers who termed it against Islam to fix the age of puberty, the Express Tribune reported.Senator Ghafoor Haidri raised an objection, saying fixing the age of 18 years for Nikah is inconsonant with the Shariah and the bill may be sent to the Islamic Ideology Council (IIC) for further discussion. Federal Minister for Religious Affairs Noorul Qadri said a similar bill was sent to the IIC in 2010 which was returned by the council with the observation that according to Fuqaha, the age of puberty varies and cannot be fixed.Former Senate chairman, Senator Raza Rabbani, supported the bill and apprised the house that the bill was earlier sent to the IIC, where it remained pending there for years without discussion. He said that the Sindh Assembly had already passed the same bill which was not challenged or opposed at any forum so far.He further said the age of puberty of girls in other Islamic countries is also 18 years. The mover of the bill Senator Rehman, however, urging the Senate chairman for voting on the bill, said the age of voting, eligibility for national identity card was also 18, ""so why the age of puberty cannot be fixed accordingly.""Giving details of Muslim countries that declared 18 years as the age of puberty, she said, in Algeria the age was 19, while Bangladesh, Egypt, Turkey, Morocco, Oman, United Arab Emirates, and even the Saudi Arabia had fixed 18 years as the age of puberty.

Winding up the debate on the bill, the Senate chairman sought voting and passed the bill with an opposition of five votes, according to the paper.",http://www.newindianexpress.com/world/2019/apr/30/pakistan-senate-passes-bill-to-fix-18-years-as-age-of-puberty-for-girls-1970966.html?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko's love story was dubbed the ""tennis court romance"" as they met over the nets. The 85-year-old Emperor stepped down today after three decades on the throne because of his age and declining health.",Reuters,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese Emperor Akihito, in his final remarks as his three-decade reign drew to a close on Tuesday, thanked the people for their support and expressed hope for a peaceful future. Akihito, 85, the first monarch to abdicate in two centuries, had sought to ease the painful memories of World War Two and bring the monarchy closer to the people, including those marginalised in society. The popular Akihito was the first monarch to take the Chrysanthemum Throne under a post-war constitution that defines the emperor as a symbol of the people without political power. His father, Hirohito, in whose name Japanese troops fought World War Two, was considered a living deity until after Japan’s defeat in 1945, when he renounced his divinity. “To the people who accepted and supported me as a symbol, I express my heartfelt thanks,” Akihito, wearing a Western-style morning coat, said at a brief abdication ceremony in the Imperial Palace’s Matsu no ma, or Hall of Pine. “Together with the empress, I hope from my heart that the new Reiwa era that begins tomorrow will be peaceful and fruitful, and pray for the peace and happiness of our country and the people of the world,” said a solemn Akihito, referring to the new imperial era. Standing on a white dais flanked by Empress Michiko, who wore a long white and grey dress, Akihito bowed after he spoke. About 300 people attended the ceremony broadcast live on television. They included Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Crown Prince Naruhito and Crown Princess Masako, as well as the heads of both houses of parliament and Supreme Court justices. Akihito, together with Michiko, his wife of 60 years and the first commoner to marry an imperial heir, carved out an active role as a symbol of reconciliation, peace and democracy. Akihito, who has had treatment for prostate cancer and heart surgery, said in a televised address in 2016 that he feared his age would make it hard for him to carry out his duties fully. At the start of the ceremony, chamberlains carried the state and privy seals into the hall along with two of Japan’s “Three Sacred Treasures” - a sword and a jewel - which together with a mirror are symbols of the throne. They are said to originate in ancient mythology. “While keeping in our hearts the path that the emperor has walked, we will make utmost efforts to create a bright future for a proud Japan that is full of peace and  hope,” Abe said ahead of the emperor’s remarks. At the end of the ceremony, Akihito descended from the dais and took Michiko’s hand as she stepped down. Before exiting the room, he paused, turned toward the audience and bowed again. Earlier, Akihito performed a ritual announcement of his abdication in three palace sanctuaries, including one honouring the sun goddess Amaterasu Omikami, from whom mythology says the imperial line is descended, and two others for departed emperors and Shinto gods. NHK television showed Akihito, wearing a dark orange traditional robe and black headdress, walking slowly into the first sanctuary with a white-robed courtier holding the train and another carrying a sword. Naruhito conducted a similar ceremony. Crowds gathered outside the Palace, a 115-hectare compound in the heart of Tokyo protected by moats and walls, that is home to the emperor and empress. Security was tight with several thousand police officers on duty in Tokyo, media reports said. “I think the emperor is loved by the people. His image is one of encouraging the people, such as after disasters, and being close to the people,” said Morio Miyamoto, 48. “I hope the next emperor will, like the Heisei emperor, be close to the people in the same way,” he said. The Heisei imperial era, which began on Jan. 8, 1989 after Akihito inherited the throne, saw economic stagnation, natural disasters and rapid technological change.  Not everyone was excited by the imperial changeover. “It’s a normal day. That kind of political stuff is irrelevant to us ordinary people,” said Masato Saito, a 40-year-old construction worker.   “As long as they make our lives easy to live, that’s all I care.” U.S. President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania offered their “heartfelt appreciation” to the royal pair in a statement. Naruhito, 59, will inherit the throne in ceremonies on Wednesday. He studied at Oxford and together with his Harvard-educated wife, Masako, will give the monarchy a cosmopolitan flavour. Akihito officially remains emperor until midnight, when the new Reiwa era, meaning “beautiful harmony”, begins. Informal countdown events for the start of the new era were scheduled for Tuesday evening. Japanese traditionally refer to the date by the era name, or “gengo”, a system originally imported from China, on documents, calendars and coins but many people also use the Western calendar.

Naruhito conducted a similar ceremony. Crowds gathered outside the Palace, a 115-hectare compound in the heart of Tokyo protected by moats and walls, that is home to the emperor and empress. Security was tight with several thousand police officers on duty in Tokyo, media reports said. “I think the emperor is loved by the people. His image is one of encouraging the people, such as after disasters, and being close to the people,” said Morio Miyamoto, 48. “I hope the next emperor will, like the Heisei emperor, be close to the people in the same way,” he said. The Heisei imperial era, which began on Jan. 8, 1989 after Akihito inherited the throne, saw economic stagnation, natural disasters and rapid technological change.  Not everyone was excited by the imperial changeover. “It’s a normal day. That kind of political stuff is irrelevant to us ordinary people,” said Masato Saito, a 40-year-old construction worker.   “As long as they make our lives easy to live, that’s all I care.” U.S. President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania offered their “heartfelt appreciation” to the royal pair in a statement. Naruhito, 59, will inherit the throne in ceremonies on Wednesday. He studied at Oxford and together with his Harvard-educated wife, Masako, will give the monarchy a cosmopolitan flavor. Akihito officially remains emperor until midnight, when the new Reiwa era, meaning “beautiful harmony”, begins. Informal countdown events for the start of the new era were scheduled for Tuesday evening. Japanese traditionally refer to the date by the era name, or “gengo”, a system originally imported from China, on documents, calendars and coins but many people also use the Western calendar.

 In February this year, Priyanka Chopra had put out an Instagram post revealing that her brother Siddharth and Ishita had their Roka ceremony. So, when she arrived in India, people naturally assumed that it must have been for his wedding. Whether, it was the real reason for her arrival or whether the reports are true about her brother’s fiancee getting surgery and PeeCee was just wanted to be there for her family, that is yet to be confirmed. 
 Although, it could be the latter, because if indeed, Priyanka was here for her brother’s wedding then ideally, her husband and American singer, Nick Jonas would have accompanied her too. Meanwhile, Priyanka too has left the country after she was spotted at the Mumbai international airport late last night. 

 The Bollywood-turned-Hollywood diva was papped at the airport sporting an all-white look. The 36-year-old was donned a white tee along with and wide-legged white trousers while teaming it up with a long overcoat. Add to that, she accessorised her overall look with a pair of white pointed-toe heels and a white belt. But the winner was still her chic pair of eyeglasses.",https://www.timesnownews.com/entertainment/news/people/article/priyanka-chopra-s-brother-siddharth-chopra-s-wedding-postponed-here-s-what-we-know/409596?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
19881,CoA hasnÂ’t explained role: Laxman to BCCI Ombudsman,"Former Indian batsman VVS Laxman wrote a letter to BCCI Ombudsman following allegations of conflict of interest, stating that the Committee of Administrators (CoA) has still not explained their roles as members of the Cricket Advisory Committee. Laxman, along with Sachin Tendulkar, replied to notices served following a complaint of them performing as IPL team mentors and BCCI's CAC members.",India.com,"Livid with the conflict of interest allegation against him, former India batsman VVS Laxman has lambasted the Committee of Administrators‘ handling of the Cricket Advisory Committee, alleging complete lack of communication from the Vinod Rai-led panel. Laxman said the COA has been using the CAC only for the selection of senior national coaches despite promising a broader role earlier. Not known to be the most aggressive off the field, the stylish Hyderabadi, in his official response to Ombudsman-cum-Ethics-Officer, gave a rather aggressive rebuttal on the allegations of ‘Conflict of Interest’ while concluding that he is ready to “recuse” if found conflicted.“On December 7, 2018, we had written to the Committee of Administrators requesting them to clarify the scope of our role and responsibilities. To this date, there has been no reply. Since no tenure had been mentioned in the letter of intent issued in 2015, it was only reasonable to expect some communication on whether the CAC was still in existence. Unfortunately, that hasn’t been forthcoming,” Laxman wrote in his affidavit filed through his lawyer.Laxman, along with Tendulkar, replied to notices served by Ombudsman on the complaint of Madhya Pradesh Cricket Association (MPCA) life member Sanjeev Gupta for performing a dual role as mentors (Sunrisers in Laxman’s case) and CAC members. “It will be worthwhile to note that the reason I agreed to be a member was because of the various inputs we were originally tasked with contributing towards the sustained growth of Indian cricket,” he wrote in his reply.“The opportunity to be involved meaningfully in India’s climb towards becoming a cricketing superpower post-retirement was privilege enough for me to turn down the offer of remuneration of being a part of CAC,” Laxman said in his affidavit, point 3 (c). “The allegation of the complainant is baseless as we are in no manner selectors of either players or coaches and CAC is not a permanent body,” he wrote.The pertinent points were 3 (d) and (e) where he criticised the COA, insisting that the body was never really forthcoming on the scope and role of CAC. Laxman said the roles of the CAC as told to him in 2015 included focussing on improving performances of the national team overseas, creating a pathway to track a young cricketer’s career from U-19 to India A to the international team,… ODIs and Test cricket for the country’s top players, managing workload for fast bowlers, means to improve the quality of Indian spinners, and education and life-skills for young cricketers.Laxman said no such input was ever sought by the BCCI. “…none of the CAC members has (sic) been called on to give our opinion on any subjects except to be invited to be involved in the selection of national coaches and, once, the selection of junior national selectors. However, this is by no means a regular process and I am in no manner to be considered a selector.” Laxman also claimed that the COA did not even give the three-member committee — the third member being Sourav Ganguly — enough time to confirm availability to select the women’s head coach.“In December 2018, we were given a little over 24 hours to confirm our availability to be on the panel to select the India women’s head coach. All three of us expressed our inability to participate in the process due to short notice and prior commitments,” Laxman said. An ad-hoc committee, comprising Kapil Dev, Shantha Rangaswamy and Anshuman Gaekwad selected WV Raman as the head coach.Laxman urged the Ombudsman to view the “Conflict of Interest clause from the perspective of whether in the performance of my duties as a CAC member, I am being influenced by external factors.” “It is my respectful submission that when I am barely required to discharge any duties as a member of the CAC, which I wasn’t even sure existed due to the lack of communication until I received this notice, questions of any conflict of interest doesn’t arise,” wrote the veteran of 134 Tests and 8781 runs.",https://www.india.com/sports/till-date-coa-has-not-explained-our-role-angry-laxman-writes-to-ombudsman-3645092/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

The project, named E-HAV1 will deliver a full-sized prototype 500kW electric propulsor, HAV said. Earlier in January, Airlander 10 prototype was retired post successful testing.",Engadget,"The company behind the world's longest aircraft, Airlander 10, has been awarded more than £1 million ($1.3 million) to convert it into an all-electric vehicle. The test version of the slightly obscene-looking British blimp was retired back in January to make way for a production model, and it looks like said model will scrap combustion for a greener type of flight.The project has been funded by the UK Aerospace Research and Technology Programme and is nicknamed E-HAV1 after Hybrid Air Vehicles (HAV), the company that makes the 302-foot combination of airplane and airship. However, as with everything that's happened to Airlander 10 so far, it probably won't be smooth sailing.Aviation consultant Tony Dixon isn't convinced £1 million will be enough for the ambitious project, which will use the combined expertise of HAV, Collins Aerospace and the University of Nottingham to replace the blimp's engines with electric propulsion.This will require creating a full-sized 500kW electric engine, work which will likely take years to complete. When ready, the craft will ""support a broad range of activities from passenger travel to fisheries protection,"" says HAV.The test version of Airlander 10 flew just six times, two of which ended badly: it hit the ground on its second ever outing, and on another occasion managed to hurt someone when it broke away and deflated.Airlander 10 makes maiden voyage from Cardington Sheds in Bedfordshire. pic.twitter.com/Z4tN8Gnj5zThe project to turn the aircraft electric is part of HAV's plan to reduce the carbon footprint of flying and ""move us closer to our goal of zero-carbon aviation,"" says Chief Executive Stephen McGlennan.

19890,IDBI seeks deadline extension on Jaypee liquidation: Reports,Cash-strapped Jaypee Infratech's lead lender IDBI has reportedly approached the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) seeking to extend the firm's insolvency proceedings beyond the May 6 deadline. This comes as the process to find a buyer for Jaypee group's realty firm is still underway. The NCLT had in 2017 admitted an IDBI Bank-led consortium's application seeking Jaypee Infratech's resolution.,Times Now,"New Delhi: Debt-ridden Jaypee Infratech's lead lender IDBI Monday approached the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) seeking an extension of insolvency proceedings beyond the May 6 deadline as the process is still underway to find a buyer for the Jaypee group's realty firm. The bank has approached the Allahabad bench of the NCLT court to extend the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP) as the deadline expires on May 6, sources said.The NCLT has posted the matter on May 6 for the next hearing. Earlier, the NCLT had granted an extension to the lenders and Interim Resolution Professional Anuj Jain to complete the CIRP.On January 28, the NCLT had extended the period of the CIRP by another 90 days as 180 days mandated under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) was coming to an end on February 5, 2019.Under the IBC, a resolution process has to be completed under 180 days with a further extension of 90 days to 270 days. And if the company fails to complete the CIRP within the mandated 270 days, then the company goes for liquidation. According to sources, IDBI requested the tribunal to deduct the litigation period at several judicial forums, which includes the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) and the Supreme Court.IDBI's plea was supported by the representative of the home buyers, who have also got the status of financial creditors after amendments in the IBC. However, the promoters of Jaypee Infratech have opposed any move to extend the resolution period. In 2017, the NCLT admitted the application by an IDBI Bank-led consortium seeking resolution of Jaypee Infratech. In the first round of insolvency proceedings, the Rs 7,350 crore bid of Lakshdeep, part of Suraksha group, was rejected by lenders as it was found to be substantially lower than the company's net worth and assets.In October 2018, the resolution professional started a fresh initiative to revive Jaypee Infratech on the NCLT's direction. Jaypee Group's flagship firm Jaiprakash Associates Ltd (JAL) had submitted Rs 750 crore in the registry of the Supreme Court for the refund to buyers and the amount is lying with the NCLT. Jaypee Infratech is a subsidiary of JAL.Lenders and home buyers would vote on April 30 on the bid of Suraksha Realty-led consortium, as it is the only buyer left in the fray after bankers rejected the bid of state-owned NBCC. ",https://www.timesnownews.com/business-economy/companies/article/jaypee-insolvency-case-lead-lender-idbi-seeks-deadline-extension/409444?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

19893,Was told girls dancing with me must be from bad families: Shiamak,"Choreographer Shiamak Davar, while speaking on the occasion of International Dance Day on Monday, revealed that during his struggling days people told him he won't be able to make it. He added he was also told girls who dance with him must be from bad families. Shiamak further said that ""everybody can dance but everybody cannot become a dancer"".",SpotboyE,"Tomorrow is International Dance Day. Wonder which political party will have a reason to dance in Mumbai for tomorrow's performance at the Lok Sabha Polls 2019. But on the dancing stage, who better than the dance guru himself-Shiamak Davar. We spoke to Davar and asked him a whole lot of questions right from the days when he struggled to make it. ""I Won't Make It. Girls Who Dance With Me Must Be From Bad Families,"" Shiamak was told. We even asked him if it was true that only the best can join his institute, as the buzz is in the industry corridors. ""Nothing like that,"" he quipped.

Shiamak candidly admits, ""Everyboy can dance but everybody cannot become a dancer. Everybody who comes to my academy wants to become a star overnight."" He has special praise for Aishwarya Rai, Priyanka Chopra, Shahid Kapoor, Ishaan Khatter, Sushant Singh and wait... even Boman Irani! What touched us the most in the interview was that Shiamak has arrangements for even a 84-year old to learn dancing (age no bar) and limb-challenged people are specially trained with love and care to make them shake a leg.



International Dance Day is a global celebration of dance, created by the Dance Committee of the International Theatre Institute (ITI), the main partner for the performing arts of UNESCO. The event takes place every year on 29th April, the anniversary of the birth of Jean-Georges Noverre(1727–1810), the creator of modern ballet. The day strives to encourage participation and education in dance through events and festivals held on the date all over the world.

19894,Was told to move away from pic with Alia as I was dark: Shaheen,"Shaheen Bhatt has revealed when she was 12, she was asked to move away while getting clicked with younger sister Alia Bhatt and half-sister Pooja Bhatt during a photoshoot, since the photographer wanted to click only Alia and Pooja as she was ""dark"". ""My self-worth was definitely affected,"" she added. Shaheen said the incident still makes her feel ""uncomfortable"".",Times Now,"In 2016, Shaheen Bhatt shared a post that broke the internet. The author, who is Alia Bhatt’s older sister, revealed then that she had been fighting depression since the age of 13. In a recent interview, Shaheen opened about everything she deals with and all the myths around depression, and also talked about an incident that left her uncomfortable for many years.In an interview with Rajeev Masand, it was revealed that when Shaheen was all of 12, she once went to a photoshoot of her elder sister, Pooja, alog with her younger sibling, Alia. The three sisters were getting clicked when a photographer came and asked Shaheen to move away as he wanted to capture only Alia and Pooja. The incident left an indelible mark on Shaheen, and affected her self-worth.“My self worth was definitely affected because I was at an age where the seeds of that were being sown in me. I was just trying to figure out who I was and obviously when something like this happens to you at such an uncertain and unsure time in your life, it sort of reinforces that and sets it in stone. So, there was a lot of unlearning that I had to do and still have to do,” says Shaheen, adding that the incident still makes her “uncomfortable” if she thinks about it.Shaheen, who released a book called I've Never Been (un)Happier last year, says “shame is the core of depression”. “Women in general, we suffer from a lot of body image and a lot of things that we are told. It is a problem in general. Shame is the core of depression. Any kind of shame, it can be for any reason. Body image also tends to be one of the causes for shame,” she adds.  However, Shaheen is quick to affirm that in everything she has dealt with all these years, her bond with sister Alia has only become stronger.

""Kohli showed concern towards the batsman's well-being and politely asked 'How're you doing?' with a hand gesture,"" KXIP jokingly described Kohli's send-off. ""Kohli showed just why he's hailed as a beacon of sportsmanship,"" they added.",CricTracker,"Kings XI Punjab (KXIP) captain Ravichandran Ashwin, who took over last year, has had a few controversies attached to his name in Indian Premier League (IPL) 2019. First, he ‘Mankaded’ Rajasthan Royals (RR) batsman Jos Buttler, leaving the cricketing world polarised. Ashwin’s action continued to have its shadow over the tournament as other bowlers and non-striking batsmen were found indulging in near-Mankading episodes, sometimes in a light manner.However, things became serious when Ashwin’s side played Virat Kohli’s Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) in Bengaluru on April 24. On that occasion, Kohli, who is known for his passionate gestures on the ground, came out with an animated gesture at his counterpart after taking his catch in the final over.AdvertisementAshwin too was livid and he threw away his gloves after reaching the dug-out. The incident happened when the RCB required 27 runs to win in the final over and the Kings captain was caught at long-on by Kohli off the bowling of Umesh Yadav after hitting a six. Kohli’s fiery send-off to Ashwin made the headlines, as did the latter’s angry reaction.Ashwin, who plays more regularly in Tests for India, has been seen defending his captain Kohli in international games. For instance, the ace off-spinner was found taking on English pacer James Anderson in a Test series at home after the latter had targeted Kohli.Ashwin had played down the episode in Bengaluru later but the Kings did not forget the incident. On Sunday, the KXIP posted a tweet on their official handle saying the RCB captain had received a ‘Kuch Bhi Award’ from them following his gesture exhibited after taking Ashwin’s catch in the match. It was a tad surprising that the tweet came four days after the incident took place.The RCB won the match by 17 runs with their dashing batsman AB de Villiers bagging the man of the match award for scoring 82 not out off 44 balls. Kohli’s team, however, lost a key game against Delhi Capitals on Sunday that virtually pushed them out of the tournament.",https://www.crictracker.com/kxip-accords-kuch-bhi-award-to-virat-kohli-for-his-fiery-gesture-to-ravi-ashwin-rcb-reacts/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

I have received enormous support from the people of the constituency. The ruling dispensation here stands for the rich and powerful, while I stand for the common citizenry, of which I am also a part,” the Left debutant said.Dismissing allegations from his rivals that he represented a “B Team” working to help a more formidable candidate, Kumar quipped, “There is an old Bollywood number – kuchh to log kahenge, logon ka kaam hai kehna.

It’s my birthday. I always feel pressure because I want to make sure the fans are happy and I want to impress my beautiful wife (with) every match,” Russell told Jassym.Asked about his emotions about playing their last match at home this season, the West Indian said: “It’s an emotional feeling.

He added, ""We're absolutely confident that the BJP will not be able to form the government again."" He further said infiltration has increased under the NDA rule.",India.com,"Senior Congress leader P Chidambaram has described the five-year rule of the Narendra Modi government as a “complete disaster”, saying the BJP will not be able to form the next government and UPA-III could be a reality.The former Union minister also said the BJP’s “campaign of polarisation” is a complete failure in southern and western states and the impact it will have in northern and eastern India remains to be seen.“We are absolutely confident that the BJP will not be able to form the government again. The government will be a non-BJP government. Obviously, the UPA that is Congress plus pre-election allies will play a big part. If there are more post-election allies, I think UPA-III has a very good chance,” he told PTI in an interview.Giving an analysis of the performance of the Modi government, Chidambaram said on economic front, it has absolutely and conclusively established that economic growth has slowed down and “unemployment is highest in 45 years”.“In fact, I have the data put out by the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy which shows unemployment has reached 8.4 per cent in the third week of April 2019. It is the highest unemployment rate in over 45 years,” he said.On the social harmony, the former finance minister said there has been a complete breakdown of social harmony, particularly in northern states where community is pitted against community, caste is pitted against caste and all these have happened under Modi.On the security front, Chidambaram said the country was today less secured than what it was under former prime minister Manmohan Singh.“During the 10 years of the UPA rule, there was no war with Pakistan or China. Although there were infiltration and casualties, they had come down to the lowest level in 2013-14,” he said.In the ‘Modi years’, the Congress leader said, infiltration has increased year after year and there is always a danger or fear that a war may break out anytime between India and Pakistan.“It is a complete disaster,” he said.Chidambaram added that the BJP’s “campaign of polarisation” has been a complete failure in Southern India along with Gujarat, Goa and Maharashtra.“What impact it will have in central Indian states where Hindi is spoken– Rajasthan, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar and Jharkhand– remains to be seen. They again tried in (West) Bengal, they have not succeeded so far. They tried in Odisha, they have not succeeded. They are trying in Assam.“Let us see what the results will be. BJP’s polarisation campaign is a failure in the majority of states in India,” he said.Asked about the possibility of Congress chief Rahul Gandhi becoming the prime minister, Chidambaram said the Gandhi scion has made it clear that the party is not going to talk about the post of PM at this stage.“He (Rahul) has said more than once that all the opposition will gather in Delhi after the election results and decide whether we are in a position to form a government and if we are in a position to form the government, who should be the Prime Minister. It is a statesmanlike position,” he said.Asked whether there will be many claimants from the opposition for the PM’s post, the former home minister said nobody was claiming the post of the Prime Minister.“I have not heard anyone claiming the post of PM. Every party leader is entitled to say ‘if my party wins, my party can provide the PM candidate’. What is wrong with that?“Ultimately the numbers will decide who will be the PM. It is not the God-given right of Mr Modi alone to say that he can be the Prime Minister and nobody else can be the Prime Minister,” he said.Asked about the Congress’ proposed NYAY scheme, under which Rs 6,000 per month will be given to 5 crore poorest families, Chidambaram said the party has already explained the arithmetic behind the scheme and so far, nobody has challenged the arithmetic.“So why it should hurt the economy?

19910,Samsung builds vertical TV for watching smartphone videos,"Samsung has unveiled a new 43-inch vertical TV dubbed 'The Sero' that can be synced to mirror contents of users' mobile phones via near-field communication (NFC). The concept TV, which Samsung claims is based on an analysis of millennials' characteristics, can be flipped around 90 degrees for horizontal viewing similar to conventional TV. It will release in Korea in May.",Engadget,"Samsung has unveiled ""The Sero,"" a 43-inch quantum-dot QLED TV with an attention-grabbing gimmick. It can be flipped around 90 degrees, letting you watch Instagram, Snap and other smartphone videos in their native vertical configurations. Samsung said it wanted to diversify its lineup and came up with the idea by studying the tastes of mobile-loving millennials. ""Samsung will continue introducing screens that respect personal consumer tastes,"" said display president Han Jong-hee.The Sero is in the same family as Samsung's artsy Serif and Frame QLED TVs. Once you flip it into vertical mode, you can sync up and mirror content on your phone by pairing it over NFC. In horizontal mode, it works as a regular TV, delivering 4.1 channel, 60 watt sound, Bixby control and more. Samsung didn't list other specs, but it likely has 4K Ultra HD resolution.Along with showing smartphone videos, the Sero could be handy for photos and ""shopping sites with comments on the bottom,"" said Samsung. While it's the company's first vertical TV, Microsoft's Surface Hub 2 can also be flipped around 90 degrees. That model has a touchscreen, however, making it usable for presentations, brainstorming and other business chores. Samsung also announced that its Serif and Frame TVs will be available in larger 49- and 55-inch sizes later this year, with a 65-inch Frame TV coming soon as well.The Sero is an interesting idea, but vertical video haters may not want to see Samsung encouraging the practice. Also, even millenials that supposedly love Insta Stories might not want to pay a large sum to see them at 43-inches. Samsung didn't say if The Sero would come to the US, but it'll be available in Korea at the end of may for 1.9 million won (around $1,630).Update 4/29/2019 11:30 AM ET: The article originally said that the Sero would cost 18.9 million won, but that figure was in error -- it was actually 1.9 million won. It has been updated with the correct information.

19916,Luckin's discount strategy not sustainable: Starbucks CEO,"Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson has said the company's Chinese rival Luckin Coffee's strategy of building market share using ""heavy, heavy discounts"" isn't sustainable. ""We aren't only driving transaction growth and engaging new customers, but also generating return on invested capital,"" he added. Luckin, which recently filed for IPO, has said it aims to be China's largest coffee chain this year.",TechCrunch,"A war of words in the coffee world is brewing after the CEO of Starbucks  claimed Chinese upstart Luckin can’t last just days after it filed for a U.S IPO.Kevin Johnson, who leads the American coffee giant, told CNBC that competitors in China including Luckin have adopted a strategy of building market share using “heavy, heavy discounts” that he believes is not sustainable.“We’re deploying capital and building 600 new stores per year,” he said. We’re “generating the return on invested capital that we believe is sustainable to continue to build new stores at this rate for many years to come.”Starbucks claims 30,000 stores worldwide. It has been in China for 20 years and it is aiming to reach 6,000 stores in the country by 2022. Luckin, fuelled by over $550 million in VC money, has quickly scaled to reach 2,370 locations in under two years with plans to add a further 2,500 this year. That would see it overtake Starbucks — which has 3,600 stores across 150 Chinese cities — although that a metric gives a distorted view since Luckin specializes in digital orders and on-demand delivery. That’s in contrast to the retail model operated by Starbucks.Still, Starbucks has moved to close any perceived gap on service. The U.S. firm struck a partnership with Alibaba last year to tap its Ele.me service for coffee delivery and it is integrating with Alibaba’s e-commerce services.Despite the competition, Starbuck said in its a quarterly report last week that same-store comparable sales — revenue from existing stores — rose by three percent year-on-year while it grew its new store base by 17 percent. In a further boost, it said its rewards membership program reached 8.3 million with the addition of one million additional customers.“We’ve set a very good strategic foundation and we’ll continue to drive on the things that differentiate in China,” Johnson added.Despite that promising progress, the competition is sure to reach boiling point when Luckin does go public.Valued at $2.9 billion by a set of investors that include Starbucks-backer Blackrock, Luckin’s filing has a placeholder raise of $100 million which could increase as the listing process progresses. The company posted a $475 million loss in 2018, its only full year of business to date, with $125 million in revenue. For the first quarter of 2019, it carded an $85 million loss with total sales of $71 million.Starbucks doesn’t break out figures for China, but across ‘China/Asia Pacific’ in Q1, it recorded $232 million in operating income on total revenue of $1.29 billion from nearly 9,000 stores.With a strategy of growth at all cost, Luckin’s numbers are mind-boggling for a listing, let alone for an 18-month-old business.To quote Alex Wilhelm, former TechCrunch reporter and current editor of our sister publication Crunchbase: “What an amazing F-1 [filing]. I have no idea what this company is worth, how big it will get, or what it’s current health is.”Starbucks, though, is betting the fad won’t last and that its own business will continue to stand the test of time in China.Interestingly enough, other companies are already emerging to undercut Luckin — our China-based partner Technode reported that Coffee Box raised $30 million last week — while the model is being replicated in Southeast Asia. For example, in Indonesia, a startup called Fore Coffee has already raised close to $10 million for a digital-first service that uses on-demand partners for delivery.Money is no object: China’s Luckin sets sights on rivaling Starbucks",https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/29/starbucks-luckin-heavy-discount-not-sustainable/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

""Honestly, it did not bother me but it did bother my family and friends. As an individual, we all have our own identities. I was associated with a movie star and I haven't done a movie yet, doesn't make me any less. I still love myself. And I would love to be known as Harleen Sethi. I am Harleen Sethi.

Sushant was never struggling when he was worth Ankita. He was working and earning even before he met her and everything he earned is on his own. People need to seriously stop talking shit because a girl cannot gracefully accept a breakup after her disgusting parasite behaviour. More than 3 years have passed and I am disgusted hearing this filth about him. His breakup had nothing to do with his career. It was a matter of self respect and having peace of mindTo the commenter below Sushant ended a toxic relationship because he valued his self respect and took a freaking stand for himself against BS. Slut shaming a guy for a breakup from his end just because of his gender isn't what feminism is about. Think before throwing loose allegations. Ankita herself said he never cheatedSushant singh rajput is also like Vicky, one hit film and they dumped their girlfriends who stood by them in their days of struggle.Ankita messed up. Stop shaming and blaming Sushant for his gender because he respected himself and took a stand for himself. He was always more successful and independent than Ankita even before he met her he was working. She never supported him not even for a day.she reminds me of nimrit kaur..imo looks like her a bitI am happy that she thinks so, but at the same time she is hogging attention due to her connection with her EX. Do some work and then come up with such slogans. Next.If Harlen Sethi is a self respecting girl, she should not talk about it at all, is she trying to get attention simply because Vicky is getting famous? I am a 70 year old asian woman living in Switzerland, dating some one and breaking up is nothing to talk about, it happens to most educated people who are fortunate enough to have the chance of choosing one's life partner, now a days people live in together and then break up also, she should keep quiet,even good men do not talk about their relation ship, too personal, PV post it pl.I like this girls attitude..koi dokha deta hai show him his place instead of Victimizing yourself..These desi boys Ranbir, Vicky don't have the loyalty of videsi nick Jonas..one film became a hit and he started showing his true color...You should be with someone who loved when you are nobody..i think Vicky is in relationship with Bhoomi not Katrina..bcz in recent talk show feet up with stars anaita shroff said Katrina is singleI like this girl yar..so much postivity in herWho the heck is she?Kat PR calm down, not everyone is Kat T, rather these things reflect Kat the most than anyone else!!!she is using katrina connection to be poular ! so desposhe is using katrina connection to be poular ! so despoMuch much better than the so called superstar Katrina T.she is only trying to grab eyeballs...there is an agenda ...she desperately wants to be celebrity",http://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-harleen-sethi-says-i-am-no-ones-ex-current-or-future-girlfriend-448609?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

19934,Samsung patent shows new 'wraparound' smartphone display,A patent filed by Samsung shows a wraparound smartphone display that continuously covers the phone's front and part of its rear. It may be used for translation wherein one party speaks into the device in front while the other views translated words on the back. It could let users take selfies with rear camera by viewing themselves in rear display.,Engadget,"If that whole folding smartphone thing doesn't work out, Samsung has lot of other ideas cooking. It recently received patent approval for a continuous display that covers the front, while folding around the top and part of the rear of the phone, as spotted by Let's Go Digital. That would make for some interesting applications, like letting subjects see how they look before you take a photo or showing live language translations on the rear display.You could activate which part of the continuous display (front or back) to use by hovering your hand or a stylus S Pen over it. Rather than being stuck with a basic camera, you'd use the superior rear camera for selfies thanks to the rear display. The language translation part is a particularly interesting idea, as it would let each party speak while the other sees the translation -- all without the need to flip the screen around.Because it folds around the device, there could also be a display on the top that shows notifications, messages and so on. That way, it could function like a glorified pager, letting you see messages without even removing the phone from your pocket. If you wanted to reply, you could simply pull out the phone drag the message from the top to the front display.Samsung is actually a bit late to this party, as the recently released Vivo NEX Dual Display phone already has a rear screen, although it uses two separate displays, not a continuous one. Vivo has even advanced the posing feature pretty far, introducing a Pose Director that can give your subject pose suggestions from an image library.However, the translation app is an interesting idea, and a phone like this might look pretty cool thanks to the seamless display that wraps around the top. There's a chance we might see something like this, but don't bet any money on it -- patents often turn out to be duds.VideoPresenter: Terrence O'BrienScript: Terrence O'BrienScript Editor: Billy SteeleEditor: Kyle MaackProducer & Camera: Brian Oh",https://www.engadget.com/2019/04/29/samsung-smartphone-wraparound-display/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
19935,PewDiePie asks fans to end 'subscribe' meme over NZ attack,"YouTuber Felix Kjellberg, who runs channel PewDiePie, has uploaded a video calling to end the 'Subscribe to PewDiePie' meme citing the March attack on two mosques in New Zealand's Christchurch, among other incidents. The terrorist had evoked the meme during the terror attack. ""I don't support any form of racist comments or hate towards anyone,"" Kjellberg further said.",Engadget,"PewDiePie (aka Felix Kjellberg) has largely left himself out of commentary on the effects of the ""subscribe to PewDiePie"" meme that has been circulating for months, but he's now weighing in.  The YouTube star has posted a video calling on viewers to end the meme roughly a day after a shooter at a California synagogue referenced it in his screed.  While he had already used Twitter to condemn the Christchurch, New Zealand mass shooter's reference in March, he realized the meme ""should have ended then"" and that more was necessary.He said he held off saying more in March since he ""didn't want to give the terrorist more attention"" or to ""make it about me.""  Even so, he didn't want ""hateful acts"" to overwhelm the ""amazing things"" done in his name.The internet celebrity also acknowledged that two diss songs attacking T-Series, his rival for the most number of YouTube subscribers, had offended others.  He said they were ""not meant to be taken seriously"" and that he wanted to stop the ""negative rhetoric.""PewDiePie's request echoes an all-too-familiar pattern on the internet: he's trying to contain a relatively innocent meme co-opted for other, sometimes malicious purposes.  And like in those cases, there's not much the originator can do to officially stop it.  However, PewDiePie has the luxury of a massive audience for his thoughts.  He may stand a better chance than others in trying to disassociate himself from hateful acts.",https://www.engadget.com/2019/04/28/pewdiepie-asks-for-end-to-meme/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

Rear Admiral John Ring was removed from the post on Saturday, the brief statement said, without giving details about why.

President Donald Trump signed an executive order in 2018 to keep the center open, and has discussed adding to its population. Since May 2018, Guantanamo has housed 40 prisoners.

19965,"Removed parental control apps over security, not competition: Apple","Apple has defended itself after an NYT report stated it removed or restricted certain parental-control and screen-time apps, which rival its own screen-time tracker. Apple explained that several of the apps removed from App Store were using invasive technology called Mobile Device Management, which put users' privacy and security at risk. Apple added that this wasn't a matter of competition.",TechCrunch,"Apple  is defending its removal of certain parental control apps from the iOS App Store in a new statement.The company has come under fire for its removal of certain apps that were pitched as tools giving parents more control over their children’s screen-time, but that Apple said relied on technology that was too invasive for private use.“We recently removed several parental control apps from the App Store, and we did it for a simple reason: they put users’ privacy and security at risk. It’s important to understand why and how this happened,” the company said in a statement.The heart of the issue is the use of mobile device management (MDM) technologies in the parental control apps that Apple has removed from the App Store, the company said.These device management tools give control and access over a device’s user location, app use, email accounts, camera permissions and browsing history to a third party.“We started exploring this use of MDM by non-enterprise developers back in early 2017 and updated our guidelines based on that work in mid-2017,” the company said.Apple acknowledged that the technology has legitimate uses in the context of businesses looking to monitor and manage corporate devices to control proprietary data and hardware, but, the company said, it is “a clear violation of App Store policies — for a private, consumer-focused app business to install MDM control over a customer’s device.”The company said it communicated to app developers that they were in violation of App Store guidelines and gave the company 30 days to submit updates to avoid being booted from the App Store.We first reported that Apple was warning developers about screen-time apps back in December. At the time, we noted that even though Apple had never intended for the enterprise-focused MDM technology to be used in consumer-facing apps, it had greenlit a number of screen-time and parental control apps over the years that were in violation of its own guidelines.As it then began to refuse to publish these apps’ updates — the kiss of death to any app developer — there was a lot of suspicion around the timing of the crackdown, which came shortly after Apple launched its own screen-time tools.In the future, Apple could provide developers with a Screen Time API to allow them to build less invasive solutions for customers, but has made no comment on any plans in that area.Apple puts third-party screen time apps on notice“Several developers released updates to bring their apps in line with these policies,” Apple said in the statement about the removals. “Those that didn’t were removed from the App Store,” said.Going to the media is often a last resort for iOS app developers when facing a challenge to their business, as many are fearful that talking to the press will result in negative action against them.However, the timing with regard to Screen Time’s launch could be coincidental. Instead, the move to pull MDM-powered screen-time apps may be more closely tied to Apple’s privacy focus. At a time when tech companies are facing increased regulations and fines over their inability to properly protect customer’s data, Apple needed to crack down on this glaring hole, which could have led to privacy violations, and worse, those that would have involved data from children.Apple’s full statement is below:",https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/28/apple-defends-its-takedown-of-some-apps-monitoring-screen-time/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
